== Interesting Points ==

*Types*
* Turning points
	* Minimum (concave up)
	* Maximum (concave down)
* Inflection points
	* Horizontal
	* Vertical


*Nature*
* For a turning point:
	* Whether it is minimum or maximum
* For an inflection point:
	* Whether it is a horizontal or vertical inflection point
	* Whether it is on a rising or falling curve


=== Stationary Points ===

*Definition*
* Where the first derivative is equal to zero
* Includes:
	* Minimum turning points
	* Maximum turning points
	* Horizontal points of inflection


=== Concavity ===

*Definition*
* Whether a curve is concave up or concave down at a point
* Determined by sign of second derivative
* If $f''(x)$ is positive:
	* Concave up
* If $f''(x)$ is negative:
	* Concave down


== Turning Points ==

*Definition*
* Where the first derivative is equal to zero
* No change in concavity


=== Locating ===

* Solve $f'(x) = 0$


=== Determining Nature ===

*Sign Test*
* Find sign of $f'(x - a)$ and $f'(x + a)$ for some small $a$
* If positive then negative
	* Maximum turning point
* If negative then positive
	* Minimum turning point


*Second Derivative Test*
* Find sign of $f''(x)$
* If positive:
	* Minimum turning point
* If negative:
	* Maximum turning point
* If zero:
	* Inconclusive
	* Use the sign test


== Inflection Points ==

*Definition*
* Where the second derivative is equal to zero
* Change in concavity

*Types*
* Horizontal inflection
	* Rising horizontal inflection
	* Falling horizontal inflection
* Vertical inflection
	* Rising vertical inflection
	* Falling vertical inflection


=== Locating ===

*First Derivative*
* Locates horizontal inflection points and turning points
* Solve $f'(x) = 0$


*Second Derivative*
* Locates horizontal and vertical inflection points
* Solve $f''(x) = 0$


=== Determining Nature ===

*First Derivative*
* Determines if horizontal or vertical inflection point
* If $f'(x) = 0$ and $f''(x) = 0$:
	* Horizontal inflection point
* Otherwise:
	* Vertical inflection point


*Sign Test*
* Determines if rising or falling inflection point
* Find sign of $f'(x - a)$ and $f'(x + a)$ for some small $a$
* If positive then positive:
	* Rising inflection point
* If negative then negative:
	* Falling inflection point


== Derivatives From Graph ==

* Sketch first and second derivative graph from graph of $f(x)$
* First derivative graph will be a polynomial of order one less than that of
  $f(x)$
* Second derivative graph will be polynomial of order two less than that of
  $f(x)$
* Technique:
	* Map out known points
	* Determine appearance of graph around known points
	* Imagine general shape of polynomial (both positive and negative variants)
	* Join up known points


== Known Points ==

*First derivative graph*
* Passes through x axis for local maxima and minima on $f(x)$
* Graph is above x axis for positive gradients in $f(x)$
* Below x axis for negative gradients in $f(x)$
* Local maxima/minima at steepest points on $f(x)$


*Second derivative graph*
* Above x axis for concave up parts of $f(x)$
* Below x axis for concave down parts of $f(x)$
