== Estimation ==

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} & \approx \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} \\
\delta y & \approx \delta x \frac{dy}{dx} \\
\end{align*}
$$

* Be aware we can also use the inverse of the derivative $\frac{dx}{dy}$


=== Percentage Changes ===

* What is the approximate percentage change in $y$ when $x$ changes by $k$
  percent?
* Given $\frac{\delta x}{x}$
* Asked for $\frac{\delta y}{y}$

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\delta x}{x} & = \frac{k}{100} \\
\frac{dy}{dx} & \approx \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} \\
\delta y & \approx \frac{dy}{dx} \delta x \\
\frac{\delta y}{y} & \approx \frac{dy \delta x}{dx y} \\
\end{align*}
$$

* This will simplify to some constant multiplied by $\frac{\delta x}{x}$


=== Marginal Rates of Change ===

*Economic Functions*
* Cost function, $C(x)$
* Revenue function, $R(x)$
* Profit function, $P(x) = R(x) - C(x)$


*Marginal Functions*
* Marginal cost gives the cost of producing the next item at the stage of
  production where we're currently producing $x$
* Marginal cost is $C'(x)$
* Marginal cost of $x$th item is $C'(x - 1)$
* Same for revenue and profit
