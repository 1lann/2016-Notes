= Experiment 4 =

*Description*

{{$
\ce{2NO2 (g) <=> N2O4 (g)}
}}$

* Forward reaction is exothermic ($\Delta H = 57\mbox{ kJ}$)
* $\ce{NO2}$ is brown

== Pressure ==

*Description*
* Contained in gas syringe
* Instantaneously increase pressure by forcing syrine down quickly
* Hold syringe at this new pressure


*Observations*
* Turns very dark quickly
* Then gradually becomes more colourless over time


*Explanation*
* Sudden increase in concentration of $\ce{NO2}$
	* Causes gas to turn darker brown
* LCP states that the system will attempt to reduce the pressure after the
  sudden increase
	* Shift equilibrium to the right
	* As it is the side with fewer moles of gas
	* Decreases concentration of $\ce{NO2}$
	* Makes gas more colourless


== Temperature ==

*Description*
* Two sealed containers of gas
* One submerged in an ice bath
* Other heated over a bunsen burner


*Observations*
* Container in ice bath will turn colourless
* Container over bunsen burner will turn darker brown


*Explanation*
* LCP states that if the temperature of a system is increased or decreased, the
  system will favour the exothermic or endothermic reaction to try and offset
  the change in temperature
* When submerged in the ice bath, the system will favour the exothermic reaction
  (the forward reaction)
	* Turns colourless
* When heated, system will favour the endothermic reaction (the reverse
  reaction)
	* Turns darker brown

* Sulfuric acid:
	* Acts as a catalyst for the reaction
	* Explain effect on rate of reaction
* Water:
	* Alcohol and carboxylic acid are quite potent and their smell would
	  override the smell of the ester
