= Experiment 4 =

*Description*

{{$
\ce{2NO2 (g) <=> N2O4 (g)}
}}$

* Forward reaction is exothermic ($\Delta H = 57\mbox{ kJ}$)
* $\ce{NO2}$ is brown
* $\ce{N2O4}$ is colourless


== Pressure ==

*Description*
* Contained in gas syringe
* Instantaneously increase pressure by forcing syrine down quickly
* Hold syringe at this new pressure


*Observations*
* Turns very dark quickly
* Then gradually becomes more colourless over time


*Explanation*
* Sudden increase in concentration of $\ce{NO2}$
	* Causes gas to turn darker brown
* LCP states that the system will attempt to reduce the pressure after the
  sudden increase
	* Shift equilibrium to the right
	* As it is the side with fewer moles of gas
	* Decreases concentration of $\ce{NO2}$
	* Makes gas more colourless


== Temperature ==

*Description*
* Two sealed containers of gas
* One submerged in an ice bath
* Other heated over a bunsen burner


*Observations*
* Container in ice bath will turn colourless
* Container over bunsen burner will turn darker brown


*Explanation*
* LCP states that if the temperature of a system is increased or decreased, the
  system will favour the exothermic or endothermic reaction to try and offset
  the change in temperature
* When submerged in the ice bath, the system will favour the exothermic reaction
  (the forward reaction)
	* Turns colourless
* When heated, system will favour the endothermic reaction (the reverse
  reaction)
	* Turns darker brown


= Experiment 5 =

== Chromate Equilibrium ==

*Description*

{{$
\ce{2CrO4^{2-} + 2H+ <=> Cr2O7^{2-} + H2O}
}}$

* $\ce{CrO4^{2-}}$ ion is yellow (left)
* $\ce{Cr2O7^{2-}}$ ion is orange (right)


*Addition of Acid*
* Increases concentration of $\ce{H+}$ ions
* Increases frequency of collisions between $\ce{H+}$ and chromate ion
* Instantaneously increases rate of forward reaction
* Reverse rate increases over time as more products are produced
	* Decreases concentration of $\ce{H+}$ ion over time
	* Increases concentration of dichromate ion above its original level
		* Turns more orange
* Forward rate decreases over time as reactants are used up in producing more
  products
* System approaches a new equilibrium
* Shifts equilibrium to the right
	* Turns more orange


*Addition of Base*
* Neutralises $\ce{H+}$ ions, reducing their concentration
* Reduces the frequency of collisions between $\ce{H+}$ and chromate ions
* Instantaneously decreases rate of forward reaction
* Forward reaction rate increases over time as products are used up in producing
  more reactants
	* Increases concentration of $\ce{H+}$ ion over time
	* Increases concentration of chromate ion above its original level
		* Turns more yellow
* Reverse rate decreases over time as products are used up in the reverse
  reaction
* System reaches new equilibrium
* Equilibrium shifts left
	* Turns more yellow


== Cobalt Equilibrium ==

{{$
Co(H2O)6^{2+} + 4Cl- <=> CoCl4^{2-} + 6H2O
}}$

* $\ce{Co(H2O)6^{2+}}$ ion is pale pink (almost colourless)
* $\ce{CoCl4^{2-}}$ ion is blue
* Forward reaction is endothermic


*Addition of Hydrochloric Acid*
* Increases concentration of chloride ion (due to $\ce{Cl-}$ ion in the acid)
* Shifts equilibrium right
* Turns solution more blue


*Addition of Water after Hydrochloric Acid*
* Reduces the chloride ion concentration
* Shifts equilibrium left
* Turns solution more pale pink


*Heating over Bunsen Burner*
* Increases temperature
* LCP states the system will attempt to offset this temperature increase by
  favouring the endothermic reaction (the forward reaction)
* Turns more blue


= Experiment 25 =

*Alcohols Used*
* Ethanol (primary): $\ce{CH3CH2OH}$
* Butan-1-ol (primary): $\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2OH}$
* Butan-2-ol (secondary): $\ce{CH3CH2CH(OH)CH3}$
* 2-methyl propan-2-ol (tertiary): $\ce{CH3C(CH3)(OH)CH3}$


== Dichromate ==

*Description*
* Add acidified dichromate to each (orange)
	* Will be reduced to chromate ion (deep green) as alcohol is oxidised
* Requires hot water bath
	* TODO: Why??


*Explanation*
* Ethanol:
	* Primary alcohol
	* Will be oxidsed into an aldehyde, then into a carboxylic acid
		* Ethanal, then ethanoic acid
		* Ethanal will smell sweet, fruity
		* Ethanoic acid will smell quite sharp (vinegar)
	* Will reduce the dichromate ion, turning the solution from orange to deep
	  green
* Butan-1-ol:
	* Primary alcohol
	* Oxidised first to butanal, then butanoic acid
	* Solution turns deep green
* Butan-2-ol:
	* Secondary alcohol
	* Oxidised to a ketone
		* Butanone, smells like butterscotch
	* Solution turns deep green (TODO: Check this)
* 2-methyl propan-2-ol:
	* Tertiary alcohol
	* Not oxidised at all
	* Solution stays orange


== Permanganate ==

*Description*
* Add acidified permanganate to each (purple)
	* Will be reduced to manganese ion (pale pink) as alcohol is oxidised
* Requires hot water bath


*Explanation*
* Ethanol:
	* Fully oxidised into an aldehyde, then carboxylic acid
	* Turns pale pink as permaganate ion is reduced
* Butan-1-ol:
	* Same as ethanol
* Butan-2-ol:
	* Oxidises into a ketone
	* Turns pale pink
* 2-methyl porpan-2-ol:
	* Nothing happens
	* Solution remains purple


= Experiment 26 =

*Description*
* Form esters from alcohols and carboxylic acids
* Add sulfuric acid
* Place in hot water bath
* Pour product into water before smelling


*Explanation*
* Hot water bath:
	* Higher temperature increases rate of reaction
	* Explain why
* Sulfuric acid:
	* Acts as a catalyst for the reaction
	* Explain effect on rate of reaction
* Water:
	* Alcohol and carboxylic acid are quite potent and their smell would
	  override the smell of the ester
	* Dissolve the acid and alcohol in water so that we only smell the ester
	* Explain the solubility of the acid, alcohol, and ester
