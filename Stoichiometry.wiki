== Universal Gas Law ==

$$
pV = nRT
$$

* Where:
	* $p$ is pressure
	* $V$ is volume
	* $n$ is moles of gas
	* $R$ is the universal gas constant (8.314)
	* $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin


=== Kelvin ===

$$
T_{\mbox{K}} = T_{^{\circ}\mbox{C}} + 273.15
$$

* Measure of temperature
* Symbol: $\mbox{K}$
* Scale step size is same as Celsius scale
* $0\mbox{K}$ is absolute zero
	* Where particles in the system have no kinetic energy
* $0^{\circ}\mbox{C} = 273.15\mbox{K}$


== Percentage by Mass ==

* Calculate molar mass of compound
* Calculate molar mass of component of compound in the compound's molecular
  formula
* Divide second value by first
* Example:
	* Percentage by mass of $O$ in $CO2$: $\frac{2 \times 16}{12.01 + 2 \times 16)}$


== Percentage Yield ==

$$
\mbox{yield} = \frac{\mbox{actual yield}}{\mbox{theoretical yield}} \times 100\%
$$

* Actual yield divided by theoretical yield


== Empirical Formula ==

* Find equation
* For each compound other than oxygen (for a combustion analysis):
	* Calculate moles of compound produced
	* Calculate moles of the element inside the unknown compound we care about
	* Calculate mass of element
	* Convert to percentage by mass of element in unknown compound
* Find mass of oxygen by subtracting all other masses from the original mass of
  the unknown compound
	* Convert to percentage by mass of oxygen in unknown compound
* Create table of each element
	* Add in percentage by mass (ie. mass in 100g) of each element
	* Convert to moles by dividing by molar mass
	* Divide by the smallest number to convert to a ratio
	* Multiply all the ratios make them whole numbers (if there are any
	  fractional ones)
* Use ratios to write formula


*Hydrous Salts*
* Where water is a component of the salt, held in a fixed stoichiometric ratio
  with the salt
* To find empirical formula of hydrous salt (including ratios of anhydrous
  component and water):
	* Find empirical formula of anhydrous component (as above)
	* Find mass of water and mass of anhydrous compound
	* Divide by respective molar masses
	* Divide by smallest ratio
	* Write formula


== Limiting Reactant ==

* Find equation
* Find moles of each reactant
* Pick a reactant:
	* Using stoichiometric ratios defined in equation, find moles of other
	  reactant required to fully react with the selected reactant
	* If this is less than what we have, then the selected reactant is limiting
	* If this is greater than what we have, then the other reactant is limiting
* To calculate the amount of a product produced:
	* Find moles of limiting reactant
	* Multiply by stoichiometric ratios in equation to find moles of required
	  product
	* Convert to mass
* To calculate amount of excess reactant left over:
	* Find moles of excess reactant that react by multiplying limiting reactant
	  by stoichiometric ratios in equation
	* Subtract from moles of excess reactant we have
	* Convert to mass


*Gases*
* For a gas reaction at constant pressure, temperature
* No need to convert to moles
* Can use gas volumes with stoichiometric ratios


== Efficiency Reactions ==

* To find moles of a final product produced
	* Find moles of given reactant
	* Multiply by stoichiometric ratios and efficiencies through each stage
	* Find moles of product
	* Convert to mass


*Improving Efficiency*
* For products in later stages that do not contribute to final result
	* Reuse them in earlier stages if they also act as a reactant somewhere


== Things to Remember ==

* Empirical formulas of hydrous salts must include the water's ratio
* Ensure you use every piece of information from the question
