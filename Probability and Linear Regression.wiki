= Probability =

*Definitions*
* Population
	* Set containing all possible values
* Population parameters
	* Statistics about the population
	* Eg. its mean and standard deviation
* Population mean ($\mu$)
	* Mean of all values in the population
* Population standard deviation ($\sigma$)
	* Standard deviation of all values in the population
* Random sampling
	* No restrictions are placed on choosing the elements that make up a sample
* Sample
	* A subset of the population chosen randomly
* Sample size ($n$)
	* Number of elements in a sample
	* Constant across all samples taken
* Number of samples
	* Number of samples taken
* Sample means ($\bar{X}$)
	* The set containing the mean of all samples taken from the population
* Mean of sample means ($\bar{x}$)
	* The mean of all values in the sample means set


== Central Limit Theorem ==

*Conditions*
* Samples must be randomly chosen
* Sample size must be constant across all samples
* Only applies to the set of sample means
	* Not to other statistics
	* For example, doesn't apply to the set of all sample standard deviations


*Distribution*
* If the population is known to be normally distributed
	* Sample means distribution will be normally distributed for any sample size
	  $n$
* Otherwise
	* The distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the
	  sample size is increased
	* A sample size greater than or equal to 30 is acceptable


*Mean*
* The mean of all sample means approaches the population mean


*Standard Deviation*
* The standard deviation of a set of sample means approaches
  $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
* Where:
	* $\sigma$ is the population mean
	* $n$ is the sample size


== Probability Distributions ==

*Definition*
* Table showing the probability of getting a particular value from the
  population


*Properties*
* If the population ($X$) is fair
	* Probability of chosing each element is the same
	* We say $X$ is a random variable
* Probabilities sum to 1


*Uniform Distribution*
* Probability of getting each element is the same


*Normal Distribution*
* Probability of getting elements close to the mean is higher than that of ones
  further away from the mean


=== Graphs ===

*Axes*
* Probabilities on y axis
* Values on x axis


*Drawing*
* Bar chart
* Bars centred on x axis numbers
* Gaps between bars
* Labelled axes


== Frequency Tables ==

* Table holding frequency of means between ranges of values


*Statistics on ClassPad*
* Find mean and standard deviation on ClassPad by:
	* Input midpoint of ranges in list 1
	* Input frequency in list 2
	* Go to Calc, One Variable
	* Select list 1 as the value
	* Select list 2 as the frequency
* Use $s_x$ instead of $\sigma_x$ on ClassPad for standard deviation of the
  sample means set




= Linear Regression =

*Process*
* Write equation $s$ for area of squares
	* Summation of $y_1 - (x_1 m + c)$ across all points
* Derive $s$ with respect to $m$ and $c$
* Minimise $s$ by equating the derivatives to 0
* Solve for $m$ and $c$ simultaneous


*ClassPad*
* Input all points in list 1 and 2
* Go to Calc, Regression, Linear Reg
