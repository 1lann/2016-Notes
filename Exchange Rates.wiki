= Exchange Rates =

*Definition*
* The price of one country's currency in terms of another country's currency
* Defined so that transactions can occur between countries


*Foreign Exchange Market*
* Market where the currency of other countries is bought and sold


== Measurements ==

=== Bilateral ===

*Definition*
* The bilateral exchange rate measures the value of one country's currency in
  terms of another country's currency
* Also called the cross exchange rate


*Example*
* For example, AUD in terms of USD
	* 1 AUD = 0.90 USD
	* 1 USD = 0.71 British pounds


*Quoting*
* Most commonly quoted exchange rate is the bilateral exchange rate against USD
* There are two ways to quote a currency using the bilateral exchange rate:
	* In terms of a country's purchasing power
		* 1 AUD = 0.75 USD
	* In terms of a common currency
		* 1 USD = 1.33 AUD


=== Trade Weighted Index ===

*Definition*
* The trade weighted index is a measure of movements in the Australian dollar
  against a weighted average of 20 other currencies
* The currencies are weighted according to their importance to Australia's
  international trade flows


*Advantages Over Bilateral Measure*
* TWI is more accurate and more significant than the bilateral exchange rate
  holistically
	* Though the bilateral rate is more significant for an individual travelling
	  to South Africa, for example
* As it is trade weighted, it relates to changes in performance of Australia's
  balance of payments over time


== Formula ==

* Price of good in foreign currency
	* Multiply price of good in domestic currency by the bilateral rate, quoted
	  in terms of the domestic currency (ie. domestic currency is 1)
* Price of good in domestic currency
	* Multiply price of good in foreign currency by the bilateral rate, quoted
	  in terms of the foreign currency (ie. foreign currency is 1)


*Example*
* Price in foreign currency
	* Given a good costs $60 AUD
	* The exchange rate is 1 AUD = 0.75 USD
	* The good costs $60 \times 0.75 = 45$ USD
* Price in domestic currency
	* Given a good costs $80 USD
	* The exchange rate is 1 AUD = 0.75 USD
	* The exchange rate in terms of the USD is 1 USD = $\frac{1}{0.75}$ = 1.33
	  AUD
	* The good costs $80 \times 1.33 = 106.4$ AUD


== Model ==

* The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand of the currency in the
  foreign exchange market


*Demand*
* In an international transaction where an international consumer wishes to buy
  an export produced by an Australian producer:
	* The Australian producer will expect to be paid in Australian dollars
	* The international consumer will need to convert their country's currency
	  into Australian dollars
	* They will purchase Australian dollars on the foreign exchange market,
	  creating demand for AUD
	* The purchase of the export is a credit in Australia's BOP
	* Hence the credit in the BOP represents demand for AUD
* All credits in a country's BOP represent demand for the country's currency


*Supply*
* In an international transaction where an Australian consumer wishes to buy an
  export produced by an international producer in another country:
	* Producer will expect to be paid in their country's currency
	* Australian consumer will convert AUD into the foreign currency to purchase
	  the import
	* Supplies Australian dollars to the market
	* The purchase of an import is a debit in Australia's BOP
	* Hence the debit in the BOP represents supply of AUD
* All debits in a country's BOP represents supply of the country's currency


*Increased Demand for the AUD*
* Increased demand for Australian exports
	* Exports are sold in AUD
	* Overseas consumers require AUD to purchase the exports
	* These consumers must therefore purchase AUD (demand for the dollar)
	* Examples: purchase of iron ore, overseas students studying in
	  Australia, overseas tourists travelling to Australia
* Increased foreign investment into Australia
	* Foreign investment in Australia requires AUD to perform domestic
	  transactions
	* Overseas investors must convert their money into AUD to perform these
	  transactions
	* Requires the purchase of AUD
	* Examples: construction of new mining infrastructure by an overseas
	  mining company in Australia
* Increased income receipts for Australians working overseas
	* Australians are paid in AUD
	* Companies hiring Australians must convert the income for these employees
	  into AUD
	* Requires the purchase of AUD
* Increased dividend payments to Australians who have invested in overseas
  companies
	* Dividend payments must be converted to Australian dollars before being
	  paid to Australian investors
	* Requires purchasing AUD
* Increased profit flows to Australian companies with operations overseas
	* Profit flows are converted to Australian dollars before being returned to
	  multinational companies with their headquaters in Australia


*Increased Supply of the AUD*
* Increased spending on imports
	* Imports in other countries are sold in that country's currency
	* Requires converting AUD into foreign currency
	* This is the sale of AUD in the foreign exchange market, suppling AUD to
	  the market
	* Examples: Purchase of cars from Japan, Australian tourists travelling
	  overseas, Australian students studying in overseas universities
* Increased foreign investment in other countries
	* Transactions in foreign countries that arise from investment in those
	  countries take place in the foreign country's currency
	* Requires converting AUD into foreign currency
	* Examples: an Australian company building a manufacturing plant in China
* Increased income payments to overseas residents working in Australia
	* Overseas residents are paid in their country's currency
	* Requires converting AUD to foreign currency
* Increased dividend payments to overseas investors who have invested in
  Australian companies
	* Overseas investors expect to be paid in their country's currency
	* Requires converting AUD into foreign currency
* Increased profit flows to overseas companies with operations in Australia
	* Overseas companies will convert profit made from operations in Australia
	  into the currency of the country the company's headquarters are in
	* Requires converting AUD into foreign currency


== Movements ==

*Appreciation*
* Where one unit of a currency is able to buy more units of another currency
  than it previously could


*Depreciation*
* Where one unit of a currency is only able to buy less units of another
  currency than it previously could


== Types ==

=== Floating ===

*Definition*
* Where the market forces of supply and demand alone in the foreign exchange
  market determine the price of a country's currency
* Referred to colloquially as a "clean" float


*Advantages*
* Currency can act as a shock absorber for economic shocks to the country
* Makes monetary policy more effective
* Will aid in reducing volatility in the current account balance


*Australia*
* Australia floated our currency in December 1983


=== Fixed ===

*Definition*
* Where the price of a country's currency is set at a particular value and
  maintained by the country's central bank
* Central bank may change the value they set the currency at
	* Increasing the value of the currency is called a revaluation
	* Decreasing the value of the currency is called a devaluation


*Disadvantages*
* Requires repeated intervention by the central bank to adjust the exchange rate
	* A value too low would cause a shortage of funds in the market (deficit)
	* A value too high would cause a surplus of funds in the market (surplus)


=== Managed ===

*Definition*
* Where the value of a currency is allowed to fluctuate between an acceptable
  upper and lower limit in accordance with the market forces of demand and
  supply in the foreign exchange market
* The country's central bank will intervene to prevent the currency from moving
  outside of these acceptable levels
	* Can raise or lower interest rates
	* Or buy and sell large volumes of the currency to increase supply or demand
* Most countries use this system, albeit with a fairly large acceptable range
	* Referred to colloquially as a "dirty" float


*Raising the Exchange Rate*
* To raise the exchange rate because it is reaching too low levels, the reserve
  bank could:
	* Use its reserves of foreign currency to purchase a large amount of
	  Australian dollars
		* Increases demand, causing an appreciation
	* Increase interest rates
		* Increases foreign investment into Australia, increasing demand for the
		  Australian dollar
		* Causes an appreciation


=== Sepculating ===

*Against Fixed Exchange Rate*
* Predicting the direction of the movement (revaluation or devaluation) is easy
* Knowing when the change will be made is much more difficult


*Against Floating Exchange Rate*
* You know the exchange rate will change every day
* Can't easily predict the direction of the movement (appreciation or
  depreciation)


== Balance of Payments ==

* A floating exchange rate causes a country's balance of payments to balance
	* Current account and capital and financial account sum to 0
* Exchange rate varies to change the price of transactions in the balance of
  payments
* For example:
	* If there is an excess supply of AUD because of Australians purchasing a
	  large number of imports
	* Will cause a depreciation in the AUD
	* Raises the price of imports, decreasing demand for them


== Factors Affecting ==

* Australian dollar is depreciating when looking at mid-term trends
* Depreciating since 2012
* Factors listed below in order of significance


*Terms of Trade*
* Recent unfavourable movement in the terms of trade since 2012
* Especially from 2014 onwards where the world saw a large decrease in the price
  of commodities
	* Indicated the end of the commodities price boom
* This caused a large decrease in the export price index
* Caused a significant unfavourable movement in the terms of trade
* Due to the inelasticity of our exports, this fall in price did not result in
  any significant change in volume sold
	* Inelasticity due to the lack of available substitutes for our exports
	* Intrinsic to our exports due to their composition constisting primarily of
	  natural minerals
		* Iron ore, coal, natural gas are our 3 largest exports
* This decreased our export income
	* Reduced demand for the AUD
	* Caused depreciation
* This is perhaps the most significant factor causing the depreciation over the
  last 4 years


*World Economic Growth*
* Slowing growth from China over recent years
	* Average growth over the past decade has been 10%
	* Forecasts for 2016 are 6 to 7%
* Since China is a major trading partner with Australia
	* The number 1 consumer of Australian exports
	* The number 1 country that Australia imports from
* Decrease demand for Australian exports
	* Decrease demand for AUD
	* Depreciation of AUD
* In addition, from 2014 onwards
	* There has been a surplus in the supply of base metals, particularly iron
	  ore
		* Due to large infrastruture investment during the mining boom riding on
		  the back of high commodity prices
		* Created large production capacity for commodities
	* Since iron ore is Australia's number 1 export
	* This has dramatically reduced demand for Australia's exports
	* Decrease in demand for AUD
	* Caused depreciation in AUD


*Interest Rate Differential*
* Australia currently has a higher inflation rate relative to other countries
* But we are in an expansionary phase of our monetary policy
	* Reserve bank is in the process of reducing the cash rate
* This is reducing the return investors are receiving on their investments in
  Australia
* Makes investors more likely to shift their holdings to overseas markets
	* As other countries lift their cash rates
* This increases supply of the Australian dollar in the foreign exchange market,
  causing a depreciation


*International Capital Flows and Foreign Investment*
* The stabilisation of key markets such as the US in 2013
* Combined with slowing growth in the Australian economy due to the lower growth
  in important sectors such as mining
* Caused investors to shift their holdings overseas
	* To more attractive investment destinations
* Caused decreased direct and portfolio investment in Australia
	* Decrease in demand for AUD
	* Causes a depreciation


*Relative Inflation Rate*
* Australia has benefitted from lower relative inflation rates over the previous
  two decades
	* This increased the competitiveness of our exports
	* As the prices of our exports were lower when compared to countries with
	  higher inflation rates
	* This aided in appreciating our exchange rate during the mining boom
* Australia's inflation rate was 1.7% as of December 2015
* Despite this being below the RBA's target inflation rate of between 2 and 3%
* Most other trade competing nations have had similarly low levels of inflation
	* European Union was 1.2% as of December 2015
* Hence the inflation rate has not been of major influence over the Australian
  dollar's depreciation recently


*Domestic Economic Growth*
* Australia has a high marginal propensity to import
	* Meaning strong domestic growth directly correlates with higher spending on
	  imports
	* Increases supply of AUD
	* Causes depreciation
* As of December 2015, Australia's annual GDP growth rate was 3%
	* Higher than expected
* Despite this, domestic growth is reasonably volatile
* Does not have a large influence on the exchange rate


*Speculation*
* The exchange rate is significantly influenced by speculation on the part of
  investors in the short term
	* Daily turnover according to the RBA is $180 billion
	* Eighth largest market in the world
* Since 2013, the improved performance of the US economy
* Combined with the slowing growth of the Australian economy
* Has seen demand for the AUD decrease as central banks around the world no
  longer view the AUD as an alternate, stable currency
	* Other markets have better investment opportunities
* Causes depreciation


== Effects ==

*Exports*
* As dollar depreciates, international competitiveness of exporters improve
	* Exports become cheaper for international consumers to buy
* Improvement in growth in export industries
* Can cause structural change in economy
	* For example, the conclusion of the mining boom (commodities price and TOT
	  boom) in 2012
	* Causing depreciation in Australian dollar
	* Impacts positively on other manufacturing and service providing industries
* For exporters whose contracts are denominated in foreign currency rather than
  Australian dollars
	* Rather than changing the price of their exports
	* A depreciation increases their revenue when converted back into Australian
	  dollars
* May see the beginnings of the effects of Dutch disease
	* Where displaced workers from the declining mining sector add to
	  unemployment
* Depreciation is generally good for exporters
	* May be harmful if they must import intermediate goods
	* Depreciation will cause these to cost more
	* May eliminate any additional profit incurred from the depreciation


*Imports*
* As the dollar depreciates
* Imports become more expensive for Australian consumers
* Increases the competitiveness of import-competing industries
* Encourages substitution of imported products with locally made goods
* Decreases import spending
* For example, the tourism and education sectors
	* People choosing to travel and study in Australia rather than overseas
	  because it's cheaper


*Balance of Goods and Services*
* Improvement in international competitiveness
* Increase in export income
	* After a time lag
	* As predicted by the J curve theory (??)
* Decrease in import spending
* Balance of goods and services is expected to improve
	* Move towards a surplus in the long term


*Primary Income Category of Current Account*
* Depreciation makes foreign investment in Australia cheaper
	* Australian assets are cheaper to purchase for overseas investors
* Greater foreign direct and portfolio investment will increase dividend
  payments and profit flows out of Australia
	* In addition, since a significant portion of foreign debt (between 40 and
	  60%) is denominated in foreign currency
	* Increases size of interest payments
	* Known as the valuation effect
* Thus increases deficit in primary income category
* This effect is pretty weak, as there are a lot of other factors that affect
  this deficit


*Foreign Debt*
* As a significant portion of Australia's foreign debt is denominated in foreign
  currency
	* Between 40 and 60%
	* Mainly USD, Yen, Euro, and British Pound
* The instant the AUD depreciates, there is an increase in the size of foreign
  debt in AUD terms
	* Referred to as the valuation effect


*Current Account Deficit*
* Balance of goods and services is expected to improve
* Primary income deficit is expect to increase
* Since goods and services is roughly 4 times as large as primary income in
  dollar value terms, and given the inelastic nature of Australia's exports and
  imports
* Results in the CAD decreasing


*Inflation*
* Depreciation leads to increased price of imports
* This causes tradables inflation to increase
* Given tradables represent a signficant proportion of CPI
* This could have a considerable impact on the inflation rate
* In addition, increased input costs for domestic producers
	* Due to higher prices of imported intermediate goods
	* Can also increase cost push inflation
* Increase in net exports and any multiplier effects can increase the price of
  non tradables and thus demand pull inflation
	* TODO: What??


*Economic Growth*
* Improvement in export industry
* Improvement in domestic import competing industries
* Causes increase in economic growth
* In addition to declining import spending improving aggregate demand
	* Seen most in declining outbound tourist numbers
* Since 2013 the declining mining sector has reduced this economic growth
* Can result in a two speed economy
	* Where one sector is growing rapidly, while others are slowing


*Employment*
* With increased economic growth, should cause a derived increase in demand for
  labour as output increases
* Decreases cyclical unemployment
* Increase in aggregate demand can cause a rise in output, decreasing levels of
  under employment
* Mining boom also caused structural unemployment
	* Massive appreciation of dollar
	* A factor that played a part in causing Ford to cease Australian operations
	  in 2016, Holden and Toyota in 2017


== Historical Data ==

=== Mining Boom ===

*Effect*
* Massive appreciation between 2001 - 2008


*Cause*
* Increasing demand for raw minerals on the back of large growth in countries
  with economies based heavily around manufacturing (China)
* Caused commodities price boom
* Since Australia's top exports are such commodities (Iron Ore top, 20.2% of all
  goods and services exports as at June 2015)
* Increased demand for Australian exports
* Due to large price boom, increased export income
* Increased demand for AUD
* Caused appreciation


=== GFC ===

*Effect*
* Massive depreciation between 2008 - 2009


=== Second Mining Boom ===

*Effect*
* Massive appreciation between 2009 - 2011
* Returned to levels above those of before the GFC


=== Slowing Growth in China ===

*Effect*
* Depreciation since 2012
