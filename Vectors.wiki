= Vectors =

*Definition*
* Value with direction and magnitude
* Direction usually given as worded description or bearing
* Diagramatically represented as an arrow
	* Magnitutde represented by length of arrow


*Scalars*
* Distance
* Speed


*Vectors*
* Displacement
* Velocity
* Acceleration
* Force


== Addition ==

* Place vectors end to end
* Draw in resultant vector
* Calculate magnitute using cosine rule
* Calculate angle using sine or cosine rule
	* Preferably sine as it's more accurate
* Split into components for more than 2 vectors


== Negation ==

* Reverse direction
* Magnitude remains the same


== Subtraction ==

* Add the vector to the negated verion of the other
* Split into components for more than 2 vectors


== Components ==

$$
\begin{align*}
v_x & = v \cos{\theta} \\
v_y & = v \sin{\theta} \\
\end{align*}
$$



= Velocity =

* Direction and speed at which an object is travelling


== Change in Velocity ==

$$
\Delta v = v - u
$$

* Change in velocity is final velocity ($v$) subtract initial velocity ($u$)
