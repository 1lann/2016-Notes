= Export and Import Price Index =

*Acronyms*
* XPI is export price index
* MPI is import price index


*Definition*
* Weighted average of the prices of a representative group of exports or imports
  for a country in a particular year


*Calculation*
* Select a base year
* Calculate weighted average price of exports/imports for the base year
* Assign this a value of 100
* Calculate weighted average price for subsequent years
* Divide weighted average price for subsequent years by the base year's and
  multiply by 100


*Significance*
* If the XPI or MPI is greater than 100
	* Weighted average price of imports/exports is higher than that of the base
	  year
* If the XPI or MPI is less than 100
	* Weighted average price of imports/exports is less than that of the base
	  year
* Don't care about actual number
	* Care about change in number from year to year


*Control*
* Australia's XPI and MPI set by world market
* Australia itself has little direct influence on its XPI and MPI


== Recent Trends ==

*Export Price Index*
* Decline since 2012
* Caused by end of commodities boom and slowing growth in China


*Import Price Index*
* Rising since 2011
* Caused by depreciating dollar




= Terms of Trade =

*Definition*
* Index that measures the relative movements in the prices of exports and
  imports
* Measure of price only
	* No indication of volume or value


*Meaning*
* Measures quantity of imports a country can purchase from a given quantity of
  exports
* Example:
	* Given we exported 1 car worth $1 million last year
	* We can buy $1 million worth of imports
	* With a change in price, the quantity of imports we can buy will change


== Formula ==

{{$
\frac{\mbox{\mbox{XPI}}{\mbox{MPI}}} \times 100
}}$

* Export price index divided by import price index times 100


*Derivation*
* The value of exports sold is equal to the value of imports purchased:

{{$
\begin{align*}
\mbox{XPI} \times \mbox{Export Quantity} & = \mbox{MPI} \times \mbox{Import Quantity} \\
\frac{\mbox{XPI}}{\mbox{MPI}} \times \mbox{Export Quantity} & = \mbox{Import Quantity} \\
\end{align*}
}}$


== Movements in Terms of Trade ==

* Don't care about actual value of terms of trade
* Care about movements in the value
* Writing for an unfavourable movement
	* Decline in TOT since 2012


*Terminology*
* Favourable movement
	* Increase in terms of trade relative to a previous year
* Unfavourable movement
	* Decrease in terms of trade relative to a previous year


*Favourable Movement*
* Where the XPI rises relative to the MPI
* Scenarios:
	* XPI rising, MPI falling
	* XPI rising, MPI doesn't move
	* XPI doesn't move, MPI falling
	* XPI rising, MPI rising slower
	* XPI falling, MPI falling faster

{{local:../notes/assets/economics/favourable-tot.svg}}


*Unfavourable Movement*
* Where the XPI falls relative to the MPI
* Scenarios:
	* XPI falling, MPI rising
	* XPI falling, MPI doesn't move
	* XPI doesn't move, MPI rising
	* XPI rising, MPI rising faster
	* XPI falling, MPI falling slower

{{local:../notes/assets/economics/unfavourable-tot.svg}}


== Elasticity of Demand ==

* Significance of a country's terms of trade to its economy depends on the price
  elasticity of demand for exports and imports


*Inelastic Demand*
* Like Australia
* Unfavourable movement
	* Since demand in inelastic
	* Little change in quantity of exports bought
	* Decreases export income
	* Unfavourable outcome for economy


*Elastic Demand*
* Unfavourable movement
	* Increase in quantity of exports bought due to lower price
	* May increase total value of exports sold
	* Increase in export income
	* Favourable outcome for economy


== Factors Affecting ==

=== XPI ===

*World Growth*
* Decreased growth from major trading partners (China)
	* Forecast for China's growth in 2016 is 6-7%, average over last decade is
	  10%
	* Decreases demand for our exports
	* Decreases their price
		* Price for iron ore went from around $160 a tonne at the height of the
		  mining boom to $40 a tonne recently
	* Decreases XPI
	* Causes unfavourable movement in TOT
* Productive capacity
	* Due to the commodities price boom
	* Large increase in production capacity of commodities across the world
		* Companies capitalising on high prices, aiming to increase profits
		* Eg. Brazil and Chile
	* Increases supply of commodities in the market
		* "Glut" in the market
		* Causes surplus of commodities
	* Surplus is cleared through price mechanisms
		* Decreases price
	* Decreases XPI
	* Compounds unfavourable movement


*Diversification of Exports*
* Australia has low diversity in its exports
	* We export predominantly raw minerals and agricultural products
	* Our top three exports are iron ore, coal, and natural gas
		* Account for 37% of all exports
	* A consequence of a decade long mining boom
* Decrease in the price of commodities has an amplified effect on the
  unfavourable movement in our TOT
	* Because of our reliance on these exports


=== MPI ===

*Lack of Falling Prices in Manufactures*
* 15 - 20 years ago, the emergence of China as a manufacturing powerhouse in the
  world
	* Lead to large decline in the price of manufactured products
	* Decreased our MPI
* No longer falling as rapidly as they once were
	* No longer a new phenomenon in the Australian market
* Has remained fairly flat in the last few years


*Depreciation in AUD*
* Depreciation in AUD since 2012
	* Increases price of imports in Australian dollar terms
	* Increases MPI
	* Causes unfavourable movement in TOT


== Effects ==

*Balance of Goods and Services*
* An unfavourable movement may decrease the price of our exports
* Due to the inelastic nature of Australia's exports
	* Few substitutes due to the composition of our exports
	* Can't substitute raw minerals like iron ore
* Decreases export income
* Unfavourable movement also may increase the price of our imports
	* Causes a rise in the value of import spending
* BOGS moves towards a deficit


*Current Account Deficit*
* No direct link between TOT and incomes category
* Since an unfavourable TOT movement causes an increase in BOGS deficit
	* Causes increase in CAD


*Exchange Rate*
* Decrease in XPI
	* Decrease in export income due to inelasticity of our exports
	* Decreases demand for AUD
	* Causes depreciation in exchange rate
* Increase in MPI
	* Increases import spending
	* Increases supply of AUD in market
	* Compounds depreciation


*Inflation*
* Falling export income (above) causes falling aggregate expenditure
	* Decreases demand pull inflation
	* Decreases inflation rate
* However, if the MPI increases
	* Increases costs for domestic businesses who must import intermediate goods
	  during the production of consumption goods
	* Increases cost push inflation
	* Increases inflation rate
	* This could be compounded by a depreciating dollar (caused by unfavourable
	  TOT movement)
		* Further increases import prices and cost push inflation


*Domestic Economic Growth*
* XPI decrease
	* Decreases export income (above)
	* Decreases aggregate expenditure
* MPI increase
	* Increases import spending
	* Decreases aggregate expenditure
* Decreased aggregate expenditure causes slowing economic growth
	* This may be offset slightly by the competitive advantage bestowed upon
	  import competing industries by the increased MPI


*Unemployment*
* Reduced economic growth results in an increase in cyclical unemployment
	* Fall in derived demand for labour
	* May be offset slightly by a likely increase in employment from import
	  competing industries and industries that benefit from the depreciation of
	  the AUD (tourism and education)
* Structural unemployment could occur in industries the falling XPI has severely
  affected


*Purchasing Power*
* Unfavourable movement
	* Decreases quantity of imports a country can buy from a given volume of
	  exports
	* Decreases the real purchasing power of a country's people
	* Decreases living standards


*International Competitiveness*
* Unfavourable movement
	* Decrease in XPI decreases price of exports
	* Bestows competitive advantage on Australia
	* Increases our international competitiveness


== Trade Balance ==

* A favourable movement in the TOT should cause an increase in export income
	* Due to the inelastic nature of Australia's exports
* A direct, positive, relationship between the TOT and BOGS


*Negative Relationship*
* There may be circumstances where this relationship doesn't hold
	* Where there is an increase in XPI but a dramatic decrease in volume
	* Causes a decrease in value, and hence the BOGS
	* Rather than an increase in BOGS
* Natural disaster
	* Severe reduction in export volume due to destruction of materials
	* Since price of exports is determined in the global market
		* Australia has little individual influence over the price
	* Price could still rise (favourable movement)
* Export capacity
	* Price for exports is high due to high demand
		* Since price is determined in the world market
	* But there is a cap on the capacity of exports we can produce
	* If import prices are low at the same time
	* We may import a lot more than we export (trade deficit) while still
	  having a favourable terms of trade movement


== Recent Trends ==

=== Mining Boom ===

* 2001 - 2011
* Terms of trade index rose from 52 to 107
* Favourable movement
* Large increase in commodity prices


*Causes*
* Rapid growth of emerging markets like China and India
	* Led to large increase in demand for commodities
	* Increased world commodity prices
	* Increased Australia's XPI
* China becoming world's largest manufacturer
	* Increased efficiency in producing manufactured goods
	* Fall in price of manufactured goods due to lower average costs
	* Since Australia imports a large quantity of manufactured goods
	* Fall in Australia's MPI


=== Global Financial Crisis ===

* 2008 - 2009
* Severe unfavourable movement
* Recovered quickly
	* Favourable movements through 2010 - 2012
	* Due to China stimulating their economy after the GFC


=== Recent Decline ===

* 2012 - 2016
* Unfavourable movement
* Fall in world commodity prices at end of mining boom
* Compounded by slowing growth in China
