= Export and Import Price Index =

*Acronyms*
* XPI is export price index
* MPI is import price index


*Definition*
* Weighted average of the prices of a representative group of exports for a
  country for a particular year


*Calculation*
* Select a base year
* Calculate weighted average price of exports/imports for the base year
* Assign this a value of 100
* Calculate weighted average price for subsequent years
* Divide weighted average price for subsequent years by the base year's and
  multiply by 100


*Significance*
* If the XPI or MPI is greater than 100
	* Weighted average price of imports/exports is higher than that of the base
	  year
* If the XPI or MPI is less than 100
	* Weighted average price of imports/exports is less than that of the base
	  year
* Don't care about actual number
	* Care about change in number from year to year


*Control*
* Australia's XPI and MPI set by world market
* Australia itself has little direct influence on its XPI and MPI


== Causes of Movements ==

= Terms of Trade =

*Definition*
* Index that measures the relative movements in the prices of exports and
  imports
* Measure of price only
	* No indication of volume or value


*Meaning*
* Measures quantity of imports a country can purchase from a given quantity of
  exports
* Example:
	* Given we exported 1 car worth $1 million last year
	* We can buy $1 million worth of imports
	* With a change in price, the quantity of imports we can buy will change


== Formula ==

{{$
= \frac{\mbox{\mbox{XPI} - \mbox{MPI}}{\mbox{GDP}}} \times 100
}}$

* Export price index subtract import price index divided by GDP, times 100


== Movements in Terms of Trade ==

* Don't care about actual value of terms of trade
* Care about movements in the value


*Terminology*
* Favourable movement
	* Increase in terms of trade relative to a previous year
* Unfavourable movement
	* Decrease in terms of trade relative to a previous year


*Favourable Movement*
* XPI rising, MPI falling
* XPI rising, MPI doesn't move
* XPI doesn't move, MPI falling
* XPI rising, MPI rising slower
* XPI falling, MPI falling faster

*Unfavourable Movement*
* XPI falling, MPI rising
* XPI falling, MPI doesn't move
* XPI doesn't move, MPI rising
* XPI rising, MPI rising faster
* XPI falling, MPI falling slower

{{local:../notes/assets/economics/unfavourable-tot.svg}}


== Elasticity of Demand ==

* Significance of a country's terms of trade to its economy depends on the price
  elasticity of demand for exports and imports


*Inelastic Demand*
* Like Australia
* Unfavourable movement
	* Since demand in inelastic
	* Little change in quantity of exports bought
	* Decrease in export income
	* Unfavourable outcome for economy


*Elastic Demand*
* Unfavourable movement
	* Increase in quantity of exports bought due to lower price
	* May increase total value of exports sold
	* Increase in export income
	* Favourable outcome for economy


== Causes ==

*World Growth*
* Increased world growth
	* Increased demand for our exports
	* Increases their price
	* Raises XPI
	* Favourable movement in terms of trade


== Effects ==

*National Income*
* Favourable movement
	* Assuming demand for Australia's exports is inelastic (usually is)
	* Increase balance of goods and services
	* Increase national income


*Purchasing Power*
* Favourable movement
	* Increase quantity of imports we can buy from a given volume of exports
	* Increase in living standards


*International Competitiveness*
* Favourable movement
	* Increase in export price (usually)
	* More expensive exports
	* Less competitive


=== Trade Balance ===

* Demand for Australia's exports is inelastic
* Should be a direct positive relationship between terms of trade and balance of
  goods and services
* Favourable movement
	* Increases balance of goods and service
	* Decreases CAD


*Negative Relationship*
* If there is a favourable movement in the terms of trade, but an increase in
  trade deficit
* Some other external factor has influenced volume to a large extent
* Examples:
	* Natural disaster
		* Severe reduction in export volume
		* Since price is determined in the global market where Australia has
		  little influence
		* Price could still rise (favourable terms of trade movement)
	* Export capacity
		* Price for exports is high due to high demand
		* But there is a cap on the capacity we can produce
		* If import prices are low at the same time
		* We may import a lot more than we export (trade deficit) while still
		  having a favourable terms of trade movement


== Recent Trends ==

=== Mining Boom ===

* 2001 - 2011
* Terms of trade index rose from 52 to 107
* Favourable movement
* Large increase in commodity prices


*Causes*
* Rapid growth of emerging markets like China and India
	* Led to large increase in demand for commodities
	* Increased world commodity prices
	* Increased Australia's XPI
* China becoming world's largest manufacturer
	* Increased efficiency in producing manufactured goods
	* Fall in price of manufactured goods due to lower average costs
	* Since Australia imports a large quantity of manufactured goods
	* Fall in Australia's MPI


=== Global Financial Crisis ===

* 2008 - 2009
* Severe unfavourable movement
* Recovered quickly
	* Favourable movements through 2010 - 2012
	* Due to China stimulating their economy after the GFC


=== Recent Decline ===

* 2012 - 2016
* Unfavourable movement
* Fall in world commodity prices
