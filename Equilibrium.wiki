= Energy =

== Enthalpy ==

* Means the same as energy
* Symbol: $H$
* Units: Joules ($J$)


=== Change in Enthalpy ===

* Symbol: $\Delta H$
* How much energy was released or absorbed from the surroundings during the
  course of a reaction


*Exothermic*
* Reaction releases energy to its surroundings
* Increases temperature of surroundings
* $\Delta H$ is negative
	* As enthalpy of products is less than enthalpy of reactants
* Examples
	* Bond formation
	* Cellular respiration
	* Combustion
	* Condensation
		* As intermolecular bond formation is exothermic
	* Freezing
	* Formation of a precipitate


*Endothermic*
* Reaction uses up energy from its surroundings
* Decreases temperature of surroundings
* $\Delta H$ is positive
	* As enthalpy of products is greater than enthalpy of reactants
* Examples
	* Bond breaking
	* Photosynthesis
	* Melting
		* As intermolecular bond breakage is endothermic
	* Evaporation


== Activation Energy ==

* Energy required to start reaction
* Very low activation energy reactions happen spontaneously

= Kinetic Theory =

== Reaction ==

* In order for a reaction to occur:
	* Particles must collide
	* With sufficient energy (energy greater than the activation energy)
	* With the correct orientation


== Energy Distribution Diagram ==

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/energy-distribution.svg}}

* Shows number of particles with a particular energy


== Rate of Reaction ==

* How quickly a reaction occurs
* Doesn't affect how much product is formed
* Depends on:
	* Frequency of collisions
	* Proportion of particles with energy greater than the activation energy


=== Concentration ===

* Only for aqueous ions in a liquid
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase concentration of reactant
	* Increase particles of reactant per unit volume
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Partial Pressure ===

* Only for gases
* Proportion of the pressure a gas exerts on its container that is due to a
  particular substance within the gas
	* Exactly like concentration for gases
	* Eg. in a container full of hydrogen and nitrogen, partial pressure of
	  hydrogen is the pressure exerted on the container due to the hydrogen only
	  (less than total pressure)
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase partial pressure of a substance
		* Decrease container volume
		* Increase amount of substance in container
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Surface Area ===

* Only for solids
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase surface area of solid
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Temperature ===

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/temperature-distribution.svg}}

* Kinetic energy of particles is proportional to temperature
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase temperature
	* Increase kinetic energy of particles
	* Travelling faster, have more energy
	* Increase frequency of collision
	* Increase proportion of particles with energy greater than activation
	  energy
	* Increase rate of reaction
* Effect on energy distribution diagram
	* Moves peak of graph down and right
	* Area under graph should remain the same (number of particles doesn't
	  change)


=== Catalyst ===

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/catalyst-distribution.svg}}

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/exothermic-catalyst.svg}}

* Provides an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Add catalyst
	* Decrease activation energy
	* Increase proportion of particles with energy greater than activation
	  energy
	* Increase rate of reaction




= Equilibrium =

* System is in equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate
  of the reverse reaction
	* No net change in concentration of products or reactants
* Only applies to reversible reactions
	* Usually have low activation energies
* Applies to chemical reactions and physical state changes


== Examples ==

*Physical Equilibria*
* Dissolving solid in saturated solution
	* Rate of dissolving equals rate of concentration
* Vapor pressure
	* Rate of condensation equals rate of evaporation


*Chemical Equilibria*
* $\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) <=> 2HI (g)}$
	* Hydrogen and iodine combine to form hydrogen iodide (forward reaction)
	* Hydrogen iodide breaks apart to form hydrogen and iodine (reverse
	  reaction)


== Rate vs. Time ==

For equation:

$$
\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) <=> 2HI (g)}
$$

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium-rate.svg}}

* Initial concentration of reactants is high
	* High initial forward reaction rate due to high frequency of collisions
	* Decreases exponentially over time as more reactants are used in the
	  reaction
* Initial concentration of products is 0
	* Initial reverse reaction rate is 0
	* Increases exponentially over time as more products are formed
* Rates of forward and reverse reaction eventually become equal


== Concentration vs. Time ==

For equation:

$$
\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) <=> 2HI (g)}
$$

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium-concentration.svg}}

* Initial concentration of reactants is high
* Initial concentration of products is 0
* Initial rate of change of concentration is high as rate of reaction is high
* Rate of change of concentration decreases over time as rate of reaction for
  forward reaction decreases, and rate of reverse reaction increases
* Increase in concentration of products realtive to decrease in concentration of
  reactants follows stoichiometric ratios in equation
	* In this equation, 2 times as much $\ce{HI}$ is produced as $\ce{H}$ and
	  $\ce{I}$ is used up


== Equilibrium Constant ==

For the equation:

$$
\ce{aA + bB -> cC + dD}
$$

The equilibrium constant is:

$$
K = \frac{[\mbox{C}]^c [\mbox{D}]^d}{[\mbox{A}]^a [\mbox{B}]^b}
$$

* Products divided by reactants
* Value remains constant at a given temperatue
	* Changes if temperature changes
* Only includes concentration of gases and aqueous substances
	* Solids and pure liquids are ignored
* If $K > 1$:
	* Concentration of products greater than concentration of reactants
* If $K < 1$:
	* Concentration of reactants greater than concentration of products
* Gives no indication about the rate of reaction


== Position of Equilibrium ==

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium-scale.svg}}

* Equilibrium is a position on a linear scale
* Changing environment will shift position of equilibrium
* Change relative composition of reactant and products

*Shift Left*
* Rate of reverse reaction increases
* Products used up by reverse reaction
* Decreases concentration of products
* Increases concentration of reactants


*Shift Right*
* Rate of forward reaction increases
* Reactants used up by forward reaction
* Increases concentration of products
* Decreases concentration of reactants


== Changes in Equilibrium ==

* If a change is imposed on a system in equilibrium which changes the rate of
  forward and reverse reactions by different amounts
* System will no longer be in equilibrium
* System will attempt to restore equilibrium


=== Le Châtelier's Principle ===

* For a system in equilibrium
* If a change is imposed on the system
* The system will attempt to counteract the change


*Examples*
* If the temperature is increased
	* System will attempt to decrease temperature
* If the pressure is increased
	* System will attempt to decrease the pressure


=== Concentration ===

==== Reactants ====

*Increase in a Reactant*
* System attempt to offset increase in concentration
*


==== Products ====


=== Pressure ===

* Identical to concentration
* Can be changed by:
	* Adding more or removing some of a gas
	* Decreasing or increasing the volume of the container


=== Temperature ===


=== Catalyst ===
