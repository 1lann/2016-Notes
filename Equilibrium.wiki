= Energy =

== Enthalpy ==

* Means the same as energy
* Symbol: $H$
* Units: Joules ($J$)


=== Change in Enthalpy ===

* Symbol: $\Delta H$
* How much energy was released or absorbed from the surroundings during the
  course of a reaction


*Exothermic*
* Reaction releases energy to its surroundings
* Increases temperature of surroundings
* $\Delta H$ is negative
	* As enthalpy of products is less than enthalpy of reactants
* Examples
	* Bond formation
	* Cellular respiration
	* Combustion
	* Condensation
		* As intermolecular bond formation is exothermic
	* Freezing
	* Formation of a precipitate


*Endothermic*
* Reaction uses up energy from its surroundings
* Decreases temperature of surroundings
* $\Delta H$ is positive
	* As enthalpy of products is greater than enthalpy of reactants
* Examples
	* Bond breaking
	* Photosynthesis
	* Melting
		* As intermolecular bond breakage is endothermic
	* Evaporation


== Activation Energy ==

* Energy required to start reaction
* Very low activation energy reactions happen spontaneously

*Common Examples*
* Very low
	* Ions in solution that form a precipitate


== Energy Profile Diagrams ==

* Graph
* Enthalpy on y axis
* Reaction coordinate (time) on x axis


*Features*
* $H$ of reactants
* $H$ of products
* $\Delta H$ of reaction
* Activation energy for forward and reverse reaction
* Transition state (or activated complex)


*Drawing*
* Labelled axes
	* Y is Enthalpy
	* X is Reaction Coordinate
* Axis units
	* Enthalpy is in kJ (kilojoules)
* Reactants and products written on graph
	* Above product and reactant lines
* $\Delta H$ distance marked
	* Distance between product and reactant lines
* Transition state labelled
	* Peak of activation energy curve

=== Endothermic ===

= Kinetic Theory =

== Reaction ==

* In order for a reaction to occur:
	* Particles must collide
	* With sufficient energy (energy greater than the activation energy)
	* With the correct orientation


== Energy Distribution Diagram ==

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/energy-distribution.svg}}

* Shows number of particles with a particular energy


== Rate of Reaction ==

* How quickly a reaction occurs
* Doesn't affect how much product is formed
* Depends on:
	* Frequency of collisions
	* Proportion of particles with energy greater than the activation energy


=== Concentration ===

* Only for aqueous ions in a liquid
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase concentration of reactant
	* Increase particles of reactant per unit volume
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Partial Pressure ===

* Only for gases
* Proportion of the pressure a gas exerts on its container that is due to a
  particular substance within the gas
	* Exactly like concentration for gases
	* Eg. in a container full of hydrogen and nitrogen, partial pressure of
	  hydrogen is the pressure exerted on the container due to the hydrogen only
	  (less than total pressure)
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase partial pressure of a substance
		* Decrease container volume
		* Increase amount of substance in container
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Surface Area ===

* Only for solids
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase surface area of solid
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Temperature ===

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/temperature-distribution.svg}}

* Kinetic energy of particles is proportional to temperature
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase temperature
	* Increase kinetic energy of particles
	* Travelling faster, have more energy
	* Increase frequency of collision
	* Increase proportion of particles with energy greater than activation
	  energy
	* Increase rate of reaction
* Effect on energy distribution diagram
	* Moves peak of graph down and right
	* Area under graph should remain the same (number of particles doesn't
	  change)


=== Catalyst ===

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/catalyst-distribution.svg}}

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/exothermic-catalyst.svg}}

* Provides an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Add catalyst
	* Decrease activation energy
	* Increase proportion of particles with energy greater than activation
	  energy
	* Increase rate of reaction





= Equilibrium =

* System is in equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate
  of the reverse reaction
	* No net change in concentration of products or reactants
* Only applies to reversible reactions
	* Usually have low activation energies
* Applies to chemical reactions and physical state changes


== Examples ==

*Physical Equilibria*
* Dissolving solid in saturated solution
	* Rate of dissolving equals rate of concentration
* Vapor pressure
	* Rate of condensation equals rate of evaporation


*Chemical Equilibria*
* $\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) <=> 2HI (g)}$
	* Hydrogen and iodine combine to form hydrogen iodide (forward reaction)
	* Hydrogen iodide breaks apart to form hydrogen and iodine (reverse
	  reaction)


== Reaching Equilibrium ==

$
\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) <=> 2HI (g)}
