= Energy =

== Enthalpy ==

* Means the same as energy
* Symbol: $H$
* Units: Joules ($J$)


=== Change in Enthalpy ===

* Symbol: $\Delta H$
* How much energy was released or absorbed from the surroundings during the
  course of a reaction


*Exothermic*
* Reaction releases energy to its surroundings
* Increases temperature of surroundings
* $\Delta H$ is negative
	* As enthalpy of products is less than enthalpy of reactants
* Examples
	* Bond formation
	* Cellular respiration

		* As intermolecular bond formation is exothermic
	* Freezing
	* Formation of a precipitate


*Endothermic*
* Reaction uses up energy from its surroundings

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/exothermic.svg}}


=== Endothermic ===

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/endothermic.svg}}




= Kinetic Theory =

== Reaction ==

* In order for a reaction to occur:
	* Particles must collide
	* With sufficient energy (energy greater than the activation energy)
	* With the correct orientation


== Energy Distribution Diagram ==

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/energy-distribution.svg}}

* Shows number of particles with a particular energy


== Rate of Reaction ==

* How quickly a reaction occurs
* Doesn't affect how much product is formed
* Depends on:
	* Frequency of collisions
	* Proportion of particles with energy greater than the activation energy


=== Concentration ===

* Only for aqueous ions in a liquid
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase concentration of reactant
	* Increase particles of reactant per unit volume
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Partial Pressure ===

* Only for gases
* Proportion of the pressure a gas exerts on its container that is due to a
  particular substance within the gas
	* Exactly like concentration for gases
	* Eg. in a container full of hydrogen and nitrogen, partial pressure of
	  hydrogen is the pressure exerted on the container due to the hydrogen only
	  (less than total pressure)
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase partial pressure of a substance
		* Decrease container volume
		* Increase amount of substance in container
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Surface Area ===

* Only for solids
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase surface area of solid
	* Increase frequency of collisions
	* Increase rate of reaction


=== Temperature ===

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/temperature-distribution.svg}}

* Kinetic energy of particles is proportional to temperature
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Increase temperature
	* Increase kinetic energy of particles
	* Travelling faster, have more energy
	* Increase frequency of collision
	* Increase proportion of particles with energy greater than activation
	  energy
	* Increase rate of reaction
* Effect on energy distribution diagram
	* Moves peak of graph down and right
	* Area under graph should remain the same (number of particles doesn't
	  change)


=== Catalyst ===

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/catalyst-distribution.svg}}

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/exothermic-catalyst.svg}}

* Provides an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy
* Effect on rate of reaction
	* Add catalyst
	* Decrease activation energy
	* Increase proportion of particles with energy greater than activation
	  energy
	* Increase rate of reaction




= Equilibrium =

* System is in equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate
  of the reverse reaction
	* No net change in concentration of products or reactants
* Only applies to reversible reactions
	* Usually have low activation energies
* Applies to chemical reactions and physical state changes


== Examples ==

*Physical Equilibria*
* Dissolving solid in saturated solution
	* Rate of dissolving equals rate of concentration
* Vapor pressure
	* Rate of condensation equals rate of evaporation


*Chemical Equilibria*
* $\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) <=> 2HI (g)}$
	* Hydrogen and iodine combine to form hydrogen iodide (forward reaction)
	* Hydrogen iodide breaks apart to form hydrogen and iodine (reverse
	  reaction)


== Rate vs. Time ==

For equation:

{{$
\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) <=> 2HI (g)}
}}$

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/equilibrium-rate.svg}}

* Initial concentration of reactants is high
	* High initial forward reaction rate due to high frequency of collisions
	* Decreases exponentially over time as more reactants are used in the
	  reaction
* Initial concentration of products is 0
	* Initial reverse reaction rate is 0
	* Increases exponentially over time as more products are formed
* Rates of forward and reverse reaction eventually become equal


== Concentration vs. Time ==

For equation:

{{$
\ce{H2 (g) + I2 (g) <=> 2HI (g)}
}}$

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/equilibrium-concentration.svg}}

* Initial concentration of reactants is high
* Initial concentration of products is 0
* Initial rate of change of concentration is high as rate of reaction is high
* Rate of change of concentration decreases over time as rate of reaction for
  forward reaction decreases, and rate of reverse reaction increases
* Increase in concentration of products realtive to decrease in concentration of
  reactants follows stoichiometric ratios in equation
	* In this equation, 2 times as much $\ce{HI}$ is produced as $\ce{H}$ and
	  $\ce{I}$ is used up


== Equilibrium Constant ==

For the equation:

{{$
\ce{aA + bB <=> cC + dD}
}}$

The equilibrium constant for a given temperature is:

{{$
K = \frac{[\mbox{C}]^c [\mbox{D}]^d}{[\mbox{A}]^a [\mbox{B}]^b}
}}$

* Products divided by reactants
* Value remains constant at a given temperatue
	* Changes if temperature changes
* Only includes concentration of gases and aqueous substances
	* Solids and pure liquids are ignored
* If $K > 1$:
	* Concentration of products greater than concentration of reactants
* If $K < 1$:
	* Concentration of reactants greater than concentration of products


*Concentrations at Equilibrium*
* Concentrations of reactants and products will be in stoichiometric ratios at
  equilibrium
* Only tells us about reactants and products separately
	* Can't tell concentration of a product from the concentration of a reactant


*Rate from Equilibrium Constant*
* $\Delta H$, $K$, stoichiometric ratios do not give any indication of rate of
  reaction
* If you see a question mentioning rate and it's only given you the above
  things, then it's indeterminant


== Position of Equilibrium ==

{{local:../notes/assets/chemistry/equilibrium/equilibrium-scale.svg}}

* Equilibrium is a position on a linear scale
* Changing environment will shift position of equilibrium
* Change relative composition of reactant and products
* Addition of more of a solid or liquid (not counted in equilibrium constant):
	* Doesn't affect position of equilibrium

*Shift Left*
* Rate of reverse reaction increases
* Products used up by reverse reaction
* Decreases concentration of products
* Increases concentration of reactants


*Shift Right*
* Rate of forward reaction increases
* Reactants used up by forward reaction
* Increases concentration of products
* Decreases concentration of reactants


== Changes in Equilibrium ==

* If a change is imposed on a system in equilibrium which changes the rate of
  forward and reverse reactions by different amounts
* System will no longer be in equilibrium
* System will attempt to restore equilibrium


=== Le Chatelier's Principle ===

* For a system in equilibrium
* If a change is imposed on the system
* The system will attempt to counteract the imposed change
* Can explain equilibrium changes using principle, except for changes in
  concentration


*Examples*
* If the temperature is increased
	* System will attempt to decrease temperature
* If the pressure is increased
	* System will attempt to decrease the pressure


=== Concentration ===

* Change in concentration of a substance in a reaction in equilibrium
* Must explain using collision theory

{{$
\ce{aA + bB <=> cC + dD}
}}$


*Increase in Concentration of A*
* More particles per unit volume of A
* Increased frequency of collisions with B
* Sharply increases the rate of the forward reation
* Decreases the concentration of A and B over time
	* Decreases the rate of the forward reaction over time due to lowering
	  frequency of collisions
* Increases the concentration of C and D over time
	* Increases the rate of the reverse over time due to higher frequency of
	  collisions
* Eventually reaches a stable equilibrium where the rates of the forward and
  reverse reactions are equal


*Decrease in Concentration of A*
* Less particles per unit volume of A
* Decreases frequency of collisions with B
* Sharply decreases the forward reaction rate
* Increases the concentration of A and B over time
	* Due to a relatively higher frequency of collisions between C and D
	  producing more reactants
* Decreases the concentration of C and D over time
	* Due to the decreased forward reaction rate
* Eventually reaches a stable equilibrium where the rates of the forward and
  reverse reactions are equal


*Rate of Reaction Graph*
* For an increase in concentration of A:
	* Forward reaction rate will increase sharply
	* Reverse reaction rate will increase over time, rapidly at first but
	  slowing
	* Forward reaction rate will decrease over time, rapidly at first but
	  slowing
	* Will reach new equilibrium higher than previous one


*Concentration Graph*
* For an increase in concentration of A:
	* Sharp increase in concentration of A
		* Decreases over time as it is used up by forward reaction
		* Rapidly at first due to the high forward reaction rate, but slowing
		  over time
		* Flattens out at a point above the original concentration (never
		  returns to original concentration)
	* Decrease over time in concentration of B
	* Increase over time in concentration of C and D


*Ways to Reduce Concentration*
* Adding acid
	* Increases concentration of $\ce{H+}$ ions
	* Decreases concentration of $\ce{OH-}$ ions
* Adding base
	* Watch out for $\ce{NH3}$ as a base
	* Increases concentration of $\ce{OH-}$ ions
	* Decreases concentration of $\ce{H+}$ ions
* Forming precipitate
	* Reaction produces an insoluble salt


*Addition of More of a Solid*
* Adding more of a solid doesn't affect equilibrium
* Since equilibrium constant doesn't depend on it, cannot change the equilibrium
  position


=== Pressure ===

* "Pressure" implies total pressure of the system
* "Partial pressure" is analogous to concentration for gasses
* Can be changed by:
	* Adding more or removing some of a gas
	* Decreasing or increasing the volume of the container at a fixed
	  temperature


*Increase in Total Pressure*
* Le Chatelier's principle states that when a change is imposed upon a system in
  equilibrium, the system will attempt to counteract the imposed change
* Therefore if the total pressure is increased, the system will attempt to
  decrease the total pressure
* This is done by shifting the equilibrium position to the side of the reaction
  that produces the least moles of gas
* Inverse is true for a decrease in total pressure
* If both sides have the same moles of gas:
	* Changing pressure doesn't shift the equilibrium position


*Rate of Reaction Graph*
* Increase in total pressure:
	* Both the forward and reverse reaction rate will increase sharply
	* The rate with more moles of gas will increase more, then decrease over
	  time
	* The other rate will increase over time
* Decrease in total pressure:
	* Both the forward and reverse reaction rate will decrease sharply
	* The rate with less moles of gas will decrease more, then increase over
	  time (???)
	* The other rate will decrease over time


*Concentration Graph*
* Increase in total pressure:
	* Will sharply increase concentration of reactants and products by
	  stoichiometric ratios
		* Eg. $\ce{2A <=> B}$, A will sharply increase twice as much
	* Concentration of reactants/products (whichever has the least moles of gas)
	  will increase over time
	* Other will decrease
* Opposite will happen for a decrease in total pressure


*Example*
* For the reaction: $\ce{Cl2 (g) + 3F2 (g) <=> 2ClF3 (g)}$
* If the total pressure was increased
* The system would favour the forward reaction
* The equilibrium position would shift right
* Since the products have fewer moles of gas


*Methods of Changing Pressure*
* Changing volume
* Adding inert gas at constant volume and temperature
	* Doesn't change partial pressures of reactants (same volume)
	* Doesn't change position of equilibrium
	* Doesn't change amount of any substance
* Adding inert gas with expansion of volume, constant pressure and temperature
	* Decreases partial pressure of reactants due to increased volume
	* Shifts equilibrium to the side with the most moles of gas to increase
	  pressure


*Reaction between Solid and Gasses*
* For a reaction $\ce{aA (s) <=> bB (g) + cC (g)}$
* Increase in pressure:
	* No affect on rate of forward reaction
	* Increase rate of reverse reaction, increases mass of reactant


=== Temperature ===

* Will change the equilibrium constant


*Increase in Temperature*
* Le Chatelier's principle states that when a change is imposed upon a system in
  equilibrium, the system will attempt to counteract the imposed change
* Therefore if the temperature is increased, the system will attempt to decrease
  the temperature
* System will favour the endothermic reaction
* Will increase forward/reverse reaction rate


*Rate of Reaction Graph*
* For an increase in temperature:
	* Both the forward and reverse rate of reaction will sharply increase
	* The endothermic reaction rate will increase more, then decrease over time
	* The exothermic reaction rate will increase over time
* For a decrease in temperature:
	* Both the forward and reverse rates will decrease sharply
	* The endothermic will decrease more, then increase over time
	* The exothermic will decrease over time


*Concentration Graph*
* For an increase in temperature:
	* Concentration of reactants/products (whichever are produced by the
	  endothermic reaction) will increase over time
	* Concentration of others will decrease
* Opposite will happen for a decrease in temperature


=== Catalyst ===

*Addition of Catalyst*
* Both the forward and reverse reaction rate will increase by equal amounts
* No change in concentration
* No change in amount of products/reactants produced
* Will speed up how quickly the reaction reaches equilibrium in subsequent
  changes to the equilibrium


*Rate of Reaction Graph*
* Both rates increase sharply by the same amount


*Concentration Graph*
* No change
* Remains in equilibrium


== Compromise Reactions ==

{{$
\ce{H2 + N2 <=> 2NH3 (g)}
}}$

* $\Delta H = -92\mbox{ kJ}$

*Compromise Temperature*
* In the above reaction:
	* A high temperature would increase the proportion of particles with kinetic
	  energy greater than the activation energy, and increase the frequency of
	  collisions, increasing the rate of reaction
	* A low temperature would favour the forward exothermic reaction, resulting
	  in a higher yield
* Since we have conflicting temperature requirements, a _moderate_ temperature
  is required to satisfy both constraints
* Similar situation occurs for pressure


== Harber Process ==

{{$
\ce{N2 (g) + H2 (g) <=> 2NH3 (g)}
}}$

* $\Delta H = -92\mbox{ kJ}$
* $\ce{N2}$ retrieved from air
* $\ce{H2}$ produced by steam reforming process
* Produces ammonia


*Conditions*
* High pressure
	* 10 - 25 MPa
	* Increase rate of forward reaction to produce more $\ce{NH3}$
	* Since the right side of the equilibrium has the least moles of gas
	* So the system will favour the forward reaction to decrease the pressure
	* To increase the yield
* Compromise temperature
	* $350^\circ$ to $550^\circ$ Celsius
	* High temperature to increase rate of reaction by an increased proportion
	  of particles with kinetic energy greater than the activation energy, and
	  more frequent collisions
	* Low temperature to favour forward reaction to increase yield, since the
	  forward reaction is exothermic
* Catalyst
	* Porous, so we can pass gases through it
	* $\ce{Fe3O4}$


*Yield*
* 20 - 30%
* Increase yield by reusing unreacted $\ce{N2}$ and $\ce{H2}$


=== Production of Hydrogen ===

* Performed in two steps
* Steam reforming produces the hydrogen
* Shift reaction turns toxic carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, producing more
  hydrogen in the process


==== Steam Reforming ====

{{$
\ce{CH4 (g) + H2O (g) <=> CO (g) + 3H2 (g)}
}}$

* $\Delta H = +206\mbox{ kJ}$


*Conditions*
* High temperature
	* $700^\circ$ to $1000^\circ$ Celsius
* Comprimise pressure
	* 1 to 2 MPa
* Catalyst
	* Nickel


==== Shift Reaction ====

{{$
\ce{CO (g) + H2O (g) <=> H2 (g) + CO2 (g)}
}}$

* $\Delta H = -41\mbox{ kJ}$


*Conditions*
* High pressure
	* 1 to 2 MPa
	* Same used for the steam reforming
	* Doesn't matter for yield, as there are the same moles of gas on each side
	  of the reaction
* Compromise temperature
	* $200^\circ$ to $500^\circ$ Celsius
* Catalyst
	* Mixture of $\ce{Fe2O4}$, $\ce{Cr2O}$, $\ce{CuO}$, $\ce{ZnO}$


== Contact Process ==

* Production of $\ce{H2SO4}$
* Two stages


=== Stage 1 ===

{{$
\ce{SO2 (g) + O2 (g) <=> 2SO3 (g)}
}}$

* $\Delta H = -196\mbox{ kJ}$

*Conditions*
* High pressure
	* Just above 1 atmosphere
	* Around 100 kPa
* Compromise temperature
	* $400^\circ$ to $500^\circ$ Celsius
* Catalyst
	* $\ce{V2O5}$


=== Stage 2 ===

{{$
\ce{H2SO4 + SO3 -> H2S2O7} \\
\ce{H2S2O7 + H2O -> 2H2SO4} \\
}}$

* $\ce{SO3}$ fed into absorption tower
* Meets counterflow of 98% $\ce{H2SO4}$
* $\ce{SO3}$ dissolves forming 100% $\ce{H2SO4}$
* 100% $\ce{H2SO4}$ is extracted
* Some is diluted back to 98% and reused
* Some is diluted and sold


*Pure Water*
* Pure water instead of 98% $\ce{H2SO4}$ is not used
* Because hydration of $\ce{SO3}$ is highly exothermic
* Forms a very hot and fine mist of $\ce{H2SO4}$
* Takes a long time to cool
* Would also likely cause the container to explode from sudden increase in
  pressure
