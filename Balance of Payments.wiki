= Balance of Payments =

*Definition*
* Systematic record of financial transactions between Australia and the world
* Measures movement of money across international borders
	* Not volume of goods, etc. but the money exchanged
	* Doesn't include domestic transactions
* Over a period of time
	* 1 accounting period (a year)
* Composed of two components
	* Current account (CAD)
	* Capital and financial account (KFAS)


*Credit*
* Transaction which causes money to flow into Australia
* Recorded as a positive value
* Eg. sale of a good (export), foreign investment into Australia


*Debit*
* Transaction which causes money to flow out of Australia
* Recorded as a negative value
* Eg. purchase of a good (import), foreign investments in other countries


*Balance*
* Credits plus debits
* Since debits are negative, acts as subtraction


*Surplus*
* Positive balance
* More credits than debits


*Deficit*
* Negative balance
* More debits than credits


== Structure ==

* Current account
	* Goods
	* Services
	* Primary income
	* Secondary income
* Capital and Financial account
	* Capital account
	* Financial account
* Net errors and omissions


== Current Account ==

*Contents*
* Sections
	* Goods
	* Services
	* Primary income
	* Secondary income
* Transactions generally assumed to be concluded within one accounting period
	* Concluded meaning no further economic activity will result from the
	  transaction
	* Eg. purchase of car, no money flow after initial transaction
	* Eg. loan from bank, not concluded for much longer due to interest
	  repayments


*Goods*
* Largest section in currenct account
* Examples
	* Any exported or imported physical item
	* Eg. car, fridge, bicycle
* Volatile value
* Fluctuations in value caused by
	* High marginal propensity to import
	* Exogenous events like drought, terrorism, exchange rates, etc.


*Services*
* About 25% the size of the goods category
* Examples
	* Education
		* Export/credit when a student overseas travels to Australia to attend
		  school (eg. overseas university students) and pays Australian fees
		* Import/debit when an Australian student travels overseas to attend an
		  international university, and pays international fees
	* Tourism
		* Export/credit when someone overseas travels to Australia and spends
		  money
		* Import/debit when an Australian travels overseas and spends money
	* Freight, financial, insurance, telecommunications (call centres)
* Tends to be relatively stable
* Trending towards deficit in recent years
	* Due to appreciation of Australian dollar reducing international
	  competitiveness of tourism and education
	* Appreciation caused by mining boom


*Primary Income*
* About 25% the size of goods
* Includes payment for use of another country's capital
* Examples
	* Interest payments on debt
		* Use of another country's financial capital
	* Labour costs
		* Use of another country's human capital (labour force)
	* Dividend payments
		* On stocks held in a company overseas
	* Capital gains
		* Money earned by selling capital for a higher price than it was bought
		  for
	* Profit flows
		* Profit made by companies paid into foreign countries (eg. for
		  international subsidiaries)
* Large deficit
	* Main cause of current account deficit
	* Large amount of debit transactions
	* Due to large foreign investment in Australia over the past decade, large
	  amounts are being paid back in interest payments


*Secondary Income*
* Relatively small size
* Includes one sided transactions in which nothing of economic value is received
  in return for payment
* Examples
	* Emergency relief
		* Cash payments after a natural disaster/terrorism act
	* Gifts/donations
	* Pensions
		* Eg. retired UK citizens now living in Australia receiving a pension
		  from the UK government


*Current Account Balance*
* All credits in current account plus all debits (where debits are negative)
* Usually a deficit
* CAD is current account deficit


*Other Balances*
* Merchandise balance
	* Exports of goods minus imports of goods
* Services balance
	* Exports of services minus imports of services
* Balance on goods and services (BOGS)
	* Exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services
* Income balance (net income)
	* Primary and secondary income credits minus debits
* Trade balance (net trade)
	* Exports of goods minus imports of goods
* Invisible trade balance (net invisible trade)
	* Services balance plus income balance
	* Excludes goods


== Capital and Financial Account ==

*Contents*
* Transactions that result in future financial flows in forthcoming accounting
  periods
	* Eg. loans from international banks where interest payments are paid across
	  a long period of time
* Sections
	* Capital account
	* Non-producible non-financial assets
	* Financial account
		* Direct investment flows
		* Portfolio investment flows
		* Reserve Bank flows
		* Other flows


*Capital Account*
* Relatively small (little economic effect)
* Capital transfers
* Examples
	* Foreign aid for fixed capital formation
		* Capital (eg. machinery, infrastructure) that cannot be converted into
		  cash easily
	* Capital transferred in and out of Australia by migrants
		* Eg. items in house


*Non-Producible Non-Financial Assets*
* Transactions in intellectual property
	* Copyright, patents, trademarks, franchises
* Examples
	* Harry Potter series movie rights
	* Star Wars franchise
* Patents
	* Protect inventor of new development from others stealing the idea once it
	  has been developed
	* As research and development is a risky investment (potentially no return)
	* Want to encourage it by ensuring companies can make a return on a new
	  technology without others stealing the market by stealing the technology
* Trademarks
	* Large subconsious effect, very valuable


*Financial Account*
* Largest category in capital and financial account surplus
	* Responsible for the surplus
* Includes all foreign investment
	* Direct investment
		* Investor purchases a significant controlling portion of an asset (>
		  10%)
		* Eg. share purchases, takeovers, subsidiaries, reinvestment of profits
	* Portfolio investment
		* Purchase of < 10% of an asset
		* Eg. purchase of shares, government bonds or other securities
	* International loans
		* Eg. loan from American bank to an Australian one
* Australia has accumulated a lot of foreign debt
	* 54% of Australian GDP (December 2014)
	* Large outflow in interest payments in primary income section in current
	  account
* Foreign investment in Australia also results in dividend and profit flows
  overseas
	* Also triggers large deficit through debits in primary income section


*Capital and Financial Account Balance*
* Balance on financial plus balance on capital account



== Balance ==

*Balance of Payments*
* Balance on current account plus balance on capital and financial account
* Should sum to 0 under a floating exchange rate


*Net Errors and Omissions*
* Balancing item
* Added so that the balance of payments sums to 0
* Accounts for any errors or omitted items in the transactions record


*Causes*
* Value of a currency (the exchange rate) always shifts to a new market
  equilibrium to ensure demand for the currency (credits on the balance of
  payments) equals supply (debits)
* Since credits will equal debits, the total of all transactions will sum to 0


*Usefulness*
* If the balance of payments always sums to 0, it is not of any use
* Trends in individual categories are of use
* Eg. a large surplus in the financial account indicates a large surge in
  foreign investment
	* Indicates growth in future economic activity


== Credits and Debits ==

*Credits*
* 4 types of current account credits
* Examples
	* Good: exporting iron ore
	* Service: exporting education services
	* Primary income: dividend on share purchased by foreign investor in an
	  Australian company
	* Secondary income: pension received from UK government for a retired UK
	  veteran


*Debits*
* 4 types of current account debits
* Examples
	* Good: importing cars
	* Services: import freight services to transport an export
	* Primary income: interest payment on a loan from an American bank
	* Secondary income: donation to international foreign aid program (eg.
	  private donation to world vision)


== Cross Account Effects ==

* Current account deficit
	* Leads to a capital and financial account surplus
	* Vice versa also true
* Increase in financial account surplus (foreign investment and debt)
	* Investors want a return on investment
	* Leads to larger deficit in primary income account due to interest
	  payments on loans and other outflows of capital gains (eg. profits and
	  dividends on shares)


== Trends in Current Account ==

*Factors*
* Structural
	* Remain relatively consistent despite changes in the economy
* Cyclic
	* Vary over time depending on state of economy (eg. in expansion or trough)


*Statistics*
* Average current account deficit
	* -4.5% of GDP over last 30 years
* Average balance of goods and services
	* -1.0% of GDP over last 30 years
* Average primary income
	* -3.5% of GDP over last 30 years


=== Structural ===

*Trends*
* Current account
	* Consistently a deficit (for over 2 decades)
* Primary income
	* Relatively stable, no large volatility
	* Consistently a deficit


*Causes*
* Imbalance between level of national investment (spending money) and savings
	* Small population in Australia
	* Savings pool that is inadequate to meet national investment needs
	* Numerous investment opportunities in Australia
	* High rate of investment
	* Invest more money than we save
	* Extra money invested (more than what we've saved) must come from somewhere
	* Must create a liability (eg. debt)
	* Liability comes from foreign investment
		* Credit in financial account
		* Eg. borrowing money from international banks
	* Since foreign investors require a return on investment, money must flow
	  out of Australia
		* Debit in primary income
		* Eg. interest repayments on a loan
	* Causes consistent deficit in primary income
		* Since no real volatility in primary income debits


*Cyclical Factors in Primary Income*
* Valuation effects
	* Exchange rates affect size of foreign interest repayments
	* Exchange rates are volatile, change depending on countrys' economies
	* Causes cyclic changes in primary income deficit
* Interest rates
	* Affect size of interest payments in primary income account
* Profitability of Australian businesses
	* Affects size of dividend repayments to overseas investors
	* Cyclical factor, changes depending on state of economy


=== Cyclic ===

*Trends*
* Current account
	* Large volatility over past decade
* Balance of goods and services (BOGS)
	* Large volatility
	* Caused mainly by goods (services much smaller)


*Cause for BOGS Deficit*
* Australia has a high marinal propensity to import
* Meaning value of imports are very dependent on Australian economic growth
* Value of exports tied to world economic growth
* Since Australia has had domestic growth larger than world growth over the past
  few years, we've imported more than we've exported
* Rising Australian dollar over the last decade
	* Decreased competitiveness of services sector
	* Reduced services exports
* BOGS has been a deficit


*Cause for Volatility in BOGS*
* Australia's largest exports are predominantly minerals and rural exports
* Such goods have few substitutes
* Meaning demand for goods is relatively inelastic
* Supply for exports is relatively inelastic
* Small changes in supply and demand have large changes in price
* Causes large volatility in value of goods


*Cyclical Causes*
* Terms of trade
	* Price of our exports
* Exchange rate
	* Affects price of exports relative to trading partners
* International business cycle
	* Affects volume of exports sold
* Domestic business cycle
	* Affects volume

* Exchange rate
* Competitiveness
	* Exchange rate
	* Wage rate
	* Productivity
	* Inflation rate
*


== Government Impact on Current Account Deficit ==

*Macroeconomic policy*
* Fiscal policy
	* Reduce government budget deficit or increase budget surplus
	* Based on twin deficits hypothesis
* Monetary policy
	* Reduce inflation to increase competitiveness
	* Increases exports
	* Increases value of goods
	* Reduces current account deficit
* Microeconomic reform
	* Modify policies to increase efficiency
	* Reduce regulation


== Why CAD is Good ==

* CAD caused by imbalance between national levels of investment and saving
* We are saving more than other countries
	* 22.3% of 2010-2012 GDP
	* Average of OECD countries is 20.4%
* Australia has many investment opportunities
* Hence a large amount of money is spend on investment
	* More than is saved
	* Financed by foreign investment
* Structural cause of CAD is repayments on investment in primary income account
* CAD is financing investment activity and economic growth
	* Hollistically viewed as a good thing
* Improves the country's economy
* Generates future economic growth
* Becomes a problem if debt isn't being spent on increasing national income
	* As increasing debt causes increasing interest repayments
	* Eventually unable to pay back the interest on debt
	* Not a problem with Australia as national income increasing faster than the
	  rate debt has increased
		* Debt has actually become easier to service despite growing so quickly
		* Ie. size of interest payments relative to income has decreased
