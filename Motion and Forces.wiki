= Projectile Motion =

* Object in flight


*Assumptions*
* Assume gravity acts directly down
	* Not towards centre of spherical Earth
	* Forms parabola instead of ellipse
* Assume no friction (air resistance)
	* Horizontal velocity is constant
	* Vertical velocity changed by gravity


*Variables*

* Initial velocity
* Flight time
* Maximum height
* Final velocity when the object hits the ground
* Velocity after $t$ seconds

== Flight Time ==

{{$
s_y = u_y t + \frac{1}{2} a_y t^2
}}$

* Solve for $t$ using quadratic formula


== Range ==

{{$
s_x = u_x \cos{\theta}
}}$

* Equivalent to horizontal displacement


== Maximum Height ==

{{$
0 = u_y^2 + 2 a_y s_y
}}$

* Using $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$
* Since vertical velocity is 0 at maximum height
* Solve for $s$


== Final Velocity ==

{{$
\begin{align*}
v_x & = u_x \\
v_y & = u_y + a_y t \\
\end{align*}
}}$

* Must solve for flight time first
* Final horizontal velocity is equal to initial horizontal velocity

* Take into consideration when calculating flight time


*Flat*
* $s_y$ is zero


*High to Low*
* $s_y$ is negative


*Low to High*
* $s_y$ is positive


== Air Resistance ==

DIAGRAM

* Magnitude of air resistance proportional to velocity
* Projectile will not travel as high or as far
	* Decreased maximum height
	* Decreased range
* Steeper angle to the horizontal when impacting ground
* Projectile's parabolic trajectory is no longer symmetrical
* Effect is more pronounced for faster objects
	* Eg. cannon ball compared to kicked soccer ball




= Circular Motion =

* Object travelling in circular path at a constant radius around a central point


*Period*
* Time taken for object to complete 1 revolution
* Symbol: $T$
* Units: seconds (s)
* $T = \frac{1}{f}$


*Frequency*
* Number of revolutions per second
* Symbol: $f$
* Units: Hertz (Hz)
* $f = \frac{1}{T}$


*Velocity*
* Tangential to the circle
* Direction constantly changing
* Magnitude remains constant (assuming no friction)
* Perpendicular to radius
* $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T} = 2 \pi r f$


*Acceleration*
* Always directed towards centre of circle
* $a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{4 \pi^2 r}{T^2}$


== Centripetal Force ==

* Always directed towards centre of circle
* Never draw on free body diagram
	* A net unbalanced force due to other forces acting on the object
	* Not an actual force
* Symbol: $F_c$
* $F_c = ma = \frac{mv^2}{r}$


*Solid Object*
* For a solid disk spinning (eg. a CD or DVD)
* Each part of the disk experiences a centripetal force
* Parts of the disk further away from the centre experience a larger centripetal
  force
	* Larger radius of centripetal motion
	* Same period as closer parts of the disk
	* Therefore travelling a futher distance in the same amount of time
	* Larger velocity
	* Requires larger acceleration in order to change tangential velocity
	  constantly as the disk spins
	* Therefore further away parts experience a larger force since Newton's
	  second law states that the net force on an object is proportional to its
	  acceleration


=== Horizontal Motion ===

* When circular motion is flat (parallel to ground)
* Weight force is perpendicular to centripetal force
* Do not affect each other


=== Vertical Motion ===

* If circular motion is not parallel to ground, but perpendicular
* Velocity will increase on the way down and decrease on the way up due to
  gravity
* Assume velocity to be constant usually
	* The centripetal force will also be constant
* $\sum F = F_c = T + W$


*Top of Path*
* Centripetal force acts down (towards circle centre)
* Weight of object acts down
* Tension in string also acts down
* Taking up to be positive:
	* $\sum F = F_c = -T - W$
* Tension and weight combine to create centripetal force


*Bottom of Path*
* Centripetal force acts up (towards circle centre)
* Weight of object acts down
* Tension in string acts up
* Taking up to be positive:
	* $\sum F = F_c = T - W$
* Tension must counteract weight force


*Tension*
* Tension in string at top of path is less than that at bottom of path
* Since weight always acts down and $F_c$ is constant
	* Weight and tension act in same direction at top of path, meaning tension
	  is less
	* Weight and tension act in opposite directions at bottom of path, meaning
	  tension is more to produce an upwards $F_c$


*Examples*
* Ball on string in vertical motion
* Plane doing loop
	* Normal force on pilot's chair plus pilot's weight provide centripetal
	  force


=== Conical Motion ===

*Angle from Horizontal*
* Increase velocity
	* Decreases angle from horizontal since:
	* Increased velocity requires more centripetal force to maintain a circular
	  path
	* Since the centripetal force is supplied by the tension in the string
	* The angle from horizontal will decrease to increase the size of the
	  tension component in the horizontal plane


*Over Speed Hump*
* As you go over the hump
* Move in circular path
* Weight force contributing to centripetal force
* At top of hump you have weight force acting down as centripetal force, and
  normal force acting up
* So $\sum F = F_N - mg = -\frac{mv^2}{r}$
	* Hence $F_c = mg - \frac{mv^2}{r}$
* Feel lighter at top of hump
* Minimum speed is where $F_N = 0$ (like normal)


== Apparent Weightlessness ==

* Normal force is 0
* Can work out what speed someone must travel in a vertical circular path to
  feel apparent weightlessness at the top of their path
* $\sum F = F_c = W + N$
	* $N = F_c - W = -\frac{mv^2}{r} - (-mg) = 0$
	* $F_c$ and $mg$ are negative since both are acting down at the top of the
	  path
* This velocity is the minimum speed required to maintain the circular motion
	* Minimum speed to prevent slack in a rope
	* Minimum speed to prevent people from falling out of a car on a
	  rollercoaster in a loop


*Example*
* Water in a bucket
	* Normal is 0
* Ball on a string
	* Tension is 0
	* No slack in the rope
* Rollercoaster in a loop
	* Minimum speed is when normal force at top of loop is 0


== Centrifugal Force ==

* Not an actual force
* An apparent force experienced due to inertia

TODO: Read nelson chapter


== Conical Pendulum Problem ==

*Description*
* Central pivot point above circular path
* Object attached to string, rotates at an angle to the vertical around pivot
  point
* For a given radius, there will be a certain speed the object must travel at to
  make a particular angle


*Variables*
* Mass of object
	* Unnecessary value
	* Cancels out if we work out the math
* Length of string from pivot point to object (not radius of circular motion)
* Radius of motion
* Angle string makes with vertical
* Velocity of object
* Centripetal force
* Acceleration of object
* Tension in string


*Method*
* Draw triangle combining weight and tension force to make centripetal force
* Add $\theta$ (angle with vertical) to triangle
* Find weight force
* Find centripetal force using $\tan{\theta}$
* Solve for $v$ using $F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$


*Examples*
* Ball on a string
* Plane at an angle
	* Lift perpendicular to plane
	* Acts like tension would for a ball on a string
* Car on cambered road on circular track
	* Normal force providing centripetal force
	* Travelling too slow, friction acting up the inclined plane
		* Stop car from falling down track
	* Travelling too fast, friction acting down inclined plane
		* Stop car from spinning off towards wall


*Trick*
* Plane in circular motion around a corner
	* If vertical component of lift is less than weight force
	* Will start to spiral down
	* Since there is an unbalanced force in the vertical direction

== Tricks ==

* Must write $\sum F = ma$ for every question

* Remember to convert units to SI
* $\mbox{kmh}^{-1}$ is always larger than $\mbox{ms}^{-1}$
* Write $W = \Delta E_k$ for all questions which relate work to kinetic energy
* Whenever you mention Newton first law, you have to say the object has mass and
  therefore inertia




= Gravity =

== Gravitational Fields ==

*Definition*
* Anything with mass creates a gravitational field
* Gravitational field can inflence other masses with a force
* Units: $\mbox{N m}^{-1}$ (Newtons per metre)
	* As it's force exerted by the gravitational field per unit mass
	* Equivalent to $\mbox{m s}^{-2}$ (ie. acceleration)


*Field Lines*
* Drawn around a mass to indicate direction of gravitational field
* The field is uniform around a mass - not stronger in one location
* Strength is proportional to the density of the field lines at a point
	* Density of lines decreases as distance from the object increases
* Drawing conditions:
	* Straight lines
	* Symmetrical around mass
	* Equal in length
	* Arrows pointing towards the centre of mass
	* Size of arrows proportional to strength of field
		* Draw small arrows for a small mass


== Universal Law of Gravitation ==

{{$
F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}
}}$

* Where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant
	* Units: $\mbox{N m}^{2}\mbox{ kg}^{-2}$
	* Value: $6.67 \times 10^{-11}$
* $r$ is the distance between the centres of the objects
	* Must include (for example) radius of Earth in calculations
* Force must include direction
	* For example, towards Earth or towards moon
	* For force acting on Earth, the direction is towards the moon
		* And vice versa


*Acceleration Due to Gravity*
* Equate universal law of gravitation to Newton's second law

{{$
\begin{align*}
m_1 a & = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\
a & = \frac{G m_2}{r^2} \\
\end{align*}
}}$


*Implications of Newton's Third Law*
* Becasue of Newton's third law, the gravitational force exerted by a body on
  another causes the second body to exert a force back on the first
* For example, the Earth will exert a gravitational force on the moon, and the
  moon exerts a gravitational force on the Earth
* Acceleration of Earth due to the moon's gravity is much smaller than that of
  the moon's due to Earth's gravity
	* Since mass of Earth is much larger than the moon's


*Altitude*
* Gravitational force decreases as distance from centre of object increases
	* By a factor of $r^2$
* Travelling to a higher altitude decreases the gravitational force exerted on
  a person


== Circular Motion ==

* On Earth, an object experiences a centripetal acceleration due to the Earth's
  rotation
* This reduces the normal force exerted on the object due to the object's
  inertia
	* Creates a centripetal force
* This reduces the object's apparent mass

{{$
\begin{align*}
-F_c & = N - W \\
N & = W - F_c \\
& = mg - \frac{mv^2}{r} \\
\end{align*}
}}$

* Could also calculate the mass of the object using $\frac{G m_o m_E}{r_E^2}$


== Orbital Velocity ==

{{$
\begin{align*}
F_g & = F_c \\
\frac{G m_E m_o}{r_o^2} & = \frac{m_o v^2}{r_o} \\
v^2 & = \frac{G m_E}{r_o} \\
\end{align*}
}}$

* Velocity of an object orbiting around a planet at a specific altitude ($r$)
* Doesn't depend on the mass of the object orbiting the planet
* Must show derivation in test (equate gravitational and centripetal forces)


*Increasing Forward Velocity*
* Rockets on satellite momentarily fire forwards
* Give satellite increased kinetic energy
* Increases tangental velocity of satellite
* Gravity can no longer provide the required centripetal force to sustain the
  circular path at that radius
* Satellite will move further away from the Earth, increasing its radius of
  orbit
* Increases its gravitational potential energy as the object is further from the
  Earth
* Decreases its kinetic energy due to the law of conservation of energy
* Decreases its orbital velocity


== Escape Velocity ==

{{$
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 G m_E}{r_E}}
}}$

* Velocity an object is required to travel at to escape the gravitational field
  of the Earth


== Lagrangian Points ==

*Definition*
* Altitude of orbit above Earth where the gravitational force exerted by the
  Earth and the moon are equal
* Objects at this point will not fall towards either the Earth or moon


*Derivation*

{{$
\begin{align*}
\frac{G m_E m_o}{x^2} & = \frac{G m_m m_o}{(r - x)^2} \\
\frac{m_E}{m_m} & = \frac{x^2}{(r - x)^2} \\
x & = \frac{r\sqrt{\frac{m_E}{m_m}}}{1 + \sqrt{\frac{m_E}{m_m}}} \\
\end{align*}
}}$

* Where:
	* $r$ is the distance from the centre of the Earth to the centre of the moon
	* $x$ is the distance from the centre of the Earth of the Lagrangian point
* Point is independent of the mass of the orbiting object


== Kepler's Third Law ==

*Derivation*

{{$
\begin{align*}
F_g & = F_c \\
\frac{G m_E m_o}{r_o^2} & = \frac{m_o 4 \pi^2 r}{T^2} \\
\frac{r_o^3}{T^2} & = \frac{G m_E}{4 \pi^2} \\
\end{align*}
}}$


*Variables*
* Mass of larger object being orbited (in this case, Earth)
* Radius of orbit
* Period of orbit


== Geosynchronous Orbit ==

* Period of orbit of an object around a planet matches the period of revolution
  of the planet
* Revolution must be around equator

*Second Law*
* The planets sweep out equal areas in equal time
* Regardless of their position in their elliptical orbit


== Centre of Mass ==

*Definition*
* Two objects will orbit around their centre of mass


*Relevance*
* Most of the time, the mass of the planet is much larger than the mass of the
  orbiting object
* This means the centre of mass is very close to the centre of the planet
* This makes it insignificant (when dealing with 3 significant figures) in
  calculations
* Becomes significant when the mass of the orbiting object is similar to the
  mass of the planet its orbiting


*Formula*

{{$
\mbox{centre of mass} = \frac{m_2 s}{m_1 + m_2}
}}$

* Where:
	* $m_1$ is the mass of the first object
	* $m_2$ is the mass of the second object
	* $s$ is the distance between the objects


== Barycentre ==

*Definition*
* Point around which two objects rotate
* Rotate around barycentre with equal periods
	* Always the same distance from each other and from the barycentre
* See centre of mass above


*Kepler's Third Law*
* Cannot use the equation of Kepler's third law when dealing with planets that
  orbit around a Barycentre
* In deriving Kepler's law, we assumed the radius of orbit (for centripetal
  force) was equal to the distance the objects were apart (for the gravitational
  force)
* The radius of orbit is the distance between the Barycentre and the planet
* The distance the objects are apart is greater than this

== Tricks ==

* Ensure all variables are in SI units
	* Period in seconds
	* Radius in metres
	* Number of days in a year is 365.25 (account for leap year)
* Radius of orbit is altitude plus radius of earth




= Torque =

*Definition*
* Torque is a turning effect on an object about a point
* The point about which the object rotates is called the pivot point
* A line of action is the line between the point a force acts at and the pivot
  point
* Symbol: $\tau$
* Units: $\mbox{N m}$ (Newton metres)
	* Not Joules
* It is a vector quantity and has a direction
	* Usually written clockwise or anticlockwise


*Formula*
* Torque is proportional to the distance from the pivot a force acts, and the
  mangitude of the component of the force perpendicular to the line of action
* Formula: $\tau = r F$
* A force can act at an angle to the line of action
	* Only care about perpendicular force
	* We can also use the perpendicular distance to the force instead of the
	  perpendicular force itself
	* $\tau = r F \sin{\theta}$


*Increasing Torque*
* Ways to increase the amount of torque applied include:
	* Increase the distance from the pivot ($r$)
	* Increase the mangitude of the force
	* Make $\theta$ closer to $90^\circ$


*Acceleration*
* We are only dealing with statics
* No acceleration involved


*Centre of Mass*
* Point from which an object's weight force acts
* Usually assume object is of uniform density


== Stability ==

* If the net force acting on an object acts outside its base, the object will
  fall over
	* Since the net force will produce a torque that acts in the opposite
	  direction as the force moves outside the base of the object


*Increasing Stability*
* Lower centre of mass (move towards the base)
	* Move net force (usually just weight) to within the object's base
* Increase width of base
	* Moves net force back within object's base


== Equilibrium ==

*Translational Equilibrium*
* No net translational force acting on the object
* No change in translational acceleration


*Rotational Equilibrium*
* No net torque acting on the object
* No change in rotational acceleration


=== Types of Equilibrium ===

*Stable*
* Cylinder standing on circular base
* Won't topple over if a force is exerted on it
	* No unbalanced torque
	* No change in velocity


*Neutral*
* Cylinder on side
* Will roll if pushed
	* Doesn't create an unbalanced torque
	* Causes momentary acceleration and hence a change in velocity


*Unstable*
* Cylinder balanced on edge
* Centre of mass directly over pivot point
* Will topple if pushed
	* Creates unbalanced force
	* Causes acceleration
