	* $T_1 \cos{37^\circ} - T_2 \cos{53^\circ} = 0$
* Vertical components:
	* $T_1 \sin{37^\circ} + T_2 \sin{53^\circ} - 150 = 0$

= Projectile Motion =

* Object in flight


*Assumptions*
* Assume gravity acts directly down
	* Not towards centre of spherical Earth
	* Forms parabola instead of ellipse
* Assume no friction (air resistance)
	* Horizontal velocity is constant
	* Vertical velocity changed by gravity


*Variables*
* Range
	* Distance travelled horizontally before hitting the ground
* Angle to the horizontal at which the object was fired
* Initial velocity
* Flight time
* Maximum height
* Final velocity when the object hits the ground
* Velocity after $t$ seconds
* Height above ground at which object was fired
* Height of ground above landing location


*Method*
* Solve for flight time
* Use flight time to calculate other unknowns


== Flight Time ==

$$
s_y = u_y t + \frac{1}{2} a_y t^2
$$

* Solve for $t$ using quadratic formula


== Range ==

$$
s_x = u_x \cos{\theta}
$$

* Equivalent to horizontal displacement


== Maximum Height ==

$$
0 = u_y^2 + 2 a_y s_y
$$

* Using $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$
* Since vertical velocity is 0 at maximum height
* Solve for $s$


== Final Velocity ==

$$
\begin{align*}
v_x & = u_x \\
v_y & = u_y + a_y t \\
\end{align*}
$$

* Must solve for flight time first
* Final horizontal velocity is equal to initial horizontal velocity
	* As no acceleration in horizontal direction


== Ground ==

* Changes vertical displacement ($s_y$)
* Take into consideration when calculating flight time


*Flat*
* $s_y$ is zero


*High to Low*
* $s_y$ is negative


*Low to High*
* $s_y$ is positive


== Air Resistance ==

DIAGRAM

* Magnitude of air resistance proportional to velocity
* Projectile will not travel as high or as far
	* Decreased maximum height
	* Decreased range
* Steeper angle to the horizontal when impacting ground
* Projectile's parabolic trajectory is no longer symmetrical
* Effect is more pronounced for faster objects
	* Eg. cannon ball compared to kicked soccer ball




= Circular Motion =

* Object travelling in circular path at a constant radius around a central point


*Period*
* Time taken for object to complete 1 revolution
* Symbol: $T$
* Units: seconds (s)
* $T = \frac{1}{f}$


*Frequency*
* Number of revolutions per second
* Symbol: $f$
* Units: Hertz (Hz)
* $f = \frac{1}{T}$


*Velocity*
* Tangential to the circle
* Direction constantly changing
* Magnitude remains constant (assuming no friction)
* Perpendicular to radius
* $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T} = 2 \pi r f$


*Acceleration*
* Always directed towards centre of circle
* $a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{4 \pi^2 r}{T^2}$


== Centripetal Force ==

* Always directed towards centre of circle
* Never draw on free body diagram
	* A net unbalanced force due to other forces acting on the object
	* Not an actual force
* Symbol: $F_c$
* $F_c = ma = \frac{mv^2}{r}$


*Solid Object*
* For a solid disk spinning (eg. a CD or DVD)
* Each part of the disk experiences a centripetal force
* Parts of the disk further away from the centre experience a larger centripetal
  force
	* Larger radius of centripetal motion
	* Same period as closer parts of the disk
	* Therefore travelling a futher distance in the same amount of time
	* Larger velocity
	* Requires larger acceleration in order to change tangential velocity
	  constantly as the disk spins
	* Therefore further away parts experience a larger force since Newton's
	  second law states that the net force on an object is proportional to its
	  acceleration


=== Horizontal Motion ===

* When circular motion is flat (parallel to ground)
* Weight force is perpendicular to centripetal force
* Do not affect each other


=== Vertical Motion ===

* If circular motion is not parallel to ground, but perpendicular
* Velocity will increase on the way down and decrease on the way up due to
  gravity
* Assume velocity to be constant usually
	* The centripetal force will also be constant
* $\sum F = F_c = T + W$


*Top of Path*
* Centripetal force acts down (towards circle centre)
* Weight of object acts down
* Tension in string also acts down
* Taking up to be positive:
	* $\sum F = F_c = -T - W$
* Tension and weight combine to create centripetal force


*Bottom of Path*
* Centripetal force acts up (towards circle centre)
* Weight of object acts down
* Tension in string acts up
* Taking up to be positive:
	* $\sum F = F_c = T - W$
* Tension must counteract weight force


*Tension*
* Tension in string at top of path is less than that at bottom of path
* Since weight always acts down and $F_c$ is constant
	* Weight and tension act in same direction at top of path, meaning tension
	  is less
	* Weight and tension act in opposite directions at bottom of path, meaning
	  tension is more to produce an upwards $F_c$


*Examples*
* Ball on string in vertical motion
* Plane doing loop
	* Normal force on pilot's chair plus pilot's weight provide centripetal
	  force


== Apparent Weightlessness ==

* Normal force is 0
* Can work out what speed someone must travel in a vertical circular path to
  feel apparent weightlessness at the top of their path
* $\sum F = F_c = W + N$
	* $N = F_c - W = -\frac{mv^2}{r} - (-mg) = 0$
	* $F_c$ and $mg$ are negative since both are acting down at the top of the
	  path
* This velocity is the minimum speed required to maintain the circular motion
	* Minimum speed to prevent slack in a rope
	* Minimum speed to prevent people from falling out of a car on a
	  rollercoaster in a loop


*Example*
* Water in a bucket
	* Normal is 0
* Ball on a string
	* Tension is 0
	* No slack in the rope
* Rollercoaster in a loop
	* Minimum speed is when normal force at top of loop is 0


== Centrifugal Force ==

TODO: Read nelson chapter


== Conical Pendulum Problem ==

*Description*
* Central pivot point above circular path
* Object attached to string, rotates at an angle to the vertical around pivot
  point
* For a given radius, there will be a certain speed the object must travel at to
  make a particular angle


*Variables*
* Mass of object
	* Unnecessary value
	* Cancels out if we work out the math
* Length of string from pivot point to object (not radius of circular motion)
* Radius of motion
* Angle string makes with vertical
* Velocity of object
* Centripetal force
* Acceleration of object
* Tension in string


*Method*
* Draw triangle combining weight and tension force to make centripetal force
* Add $\theta$ (angle with vertical) to triangle
* Find weight force
* Find centripetal force using $\tan{\theta}$
* Solve for $v$ using $F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$


*Examples*
* Ball on a string
* Plane at an angle
	* Lift perpendicular to plane
	* Acts like tension would for a ball on a string


*Trick*
* Plane in circular motion around a corner
	* If vertical component of lift is less than weight force
	* Will start to spiral down
	* Since there is an unbalanced force in the vertical direction


== Cambered Road ==

* Tilted road which makes an angle with the horizontal
