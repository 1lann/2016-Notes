= Functions =

*Function*
* A function takes one element from an input set and assigns it to an element
  from an output set.


*Relation*

* A relation is similar to a function, but may assign multiple outputs for one
  input.
* A relation can be turned into a function by restricting its domain.


*Types*
* One to one
	* Each input value has a unique output value
	* Eg. $y = x$
* Many to one
	* Two or more input values result in the same output value
	* Eg. $y = x^2$
* One to many
	* One input value results in two or more output values
	* Eg. $y^2 = x$


== Domain and Range ==

*Domain*
* The domain is the set of all possible input values to a function
* For example:
	* Given the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$
	* The domain is $\{x: x \in \mathbb{R}, x \neq 0\}$


*Codomain*
* The codomain is the set of all numbers a function could possibly output


*Range*
* The range is the set of all possible output values of a function
* It is a subset of the codomain
* For example:
	* Given the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$
	* The range is $\{y: y \in \mathbb{R}, y \geq 0\}$


=== Common Examples ===

*Linear*
* For the function $f(x) = ax + b$
	* The domain is $x \in \mathbb{R}$
	* The range is $y \in \mathbb{R}$


*Quadratic*
* For the function $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$
	* The range is limited to above or below the turning point of the parabola
	* The domain is $x \in \mathbb{R}$
	* If $a$ is positive, the range is $y \in \mathbb{R}, y \geq k$
	* If $a$ is negative, the range is $y \in \mathbb{R}, y \leq k$


*Polynomial*
* The domain is always $x \in \mathbb{R}$
	* No restrictions on the domain
* If the degree of the polynomial is even, then the range will be either above
  or below the minimum point of the graph
* If the degree of the polynomial is odd, then the range will be
  $y \in \mathbb{R}$


*Hyperbolic*
* Given the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x - a} + b$
* The denominator of the fraction must not be 0
	* In order to avoid a division by 0
* The entire fraction cannot equal 0
	* As the numerator is never zero
* This is due to the asymptotes at $x = a$ and $y = b$
* The domain is $x \in \mathbb{R}, x \neq a$
* The range is $y \in \mathbb{R}, y \neq b$


*Root*
* Given the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$
* The contents of the root must be greater than or equal to 0
* The result of the root will be greater than or equal to 0
* The domain will be $x \in \mathbb{R}, x \geq 0$
* The range will be $y \in \mathbb{R}, y \geq 0$


*Inverse Polynomials*
* Given the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{g(x)}$
* The only restrictions on the domain is $x$ cannot equal the vertical
  asymptotes
* Visualise the graph to determine the range
* If the degree of $g(x)$ is even, then there will be a gap between the x axis
  and the lower or upper part of the function
	* This will restrict the range
	* See the graph of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 9}$
* If the degree of $g(x)$ is odd, then there will be no gap between the x axis
  and the function
	* Range will not equal 0
	* See the graph of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^3 + 3x + x}$


*Absolute Value Functions*
* Given the function $f(x) = a|x - b| + c$
* The domain is $x \in \mathbb{R}$
* The range is above or below the point where the two branches of the function
  meet
* For example, $y \in \mathbb{R}, y \geq c$ if $a$ is positive


*Exponential Functions*
* Given the function $f(x) = e^{x - b} + a$
* The domain is $x \in \mathbb{R}$
* The range is $y \in \mathbb{R}, y > a$


*Trigonometric Functions*
* For $f(x) = a\sin{x} + b$ and $f(x) = a\cos{x} + b$
	* $x \in \mathbb{R}$
	* $y \in \mathbb{R}, -a + b \leq y \leq a + b$
* For $f(x) = \tan{x}$
	* $x \in \mathbb{R}, x \neq \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi$, for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$
	* $y \in \mathbb{R}$
* For $f(x) = \csc{x}$
	* TODO:
* For $f(x) = \sec{x}$
	* TODO:
* For $f(x) = \cot{x}$
	* TODO:


== Tests ==

*Vertical Line Test*
* The graph is a function if it passes the vertical line test
* Every vertical line should only intersect the graph at 1 point
	* The graphs $x = k, k \in \mathbb{R}$ and $f(x)$ should only have 1
	  solution for all $k$


*Horizontal Line Test*
* The function is one to one if it passes the horizontal line test
* Every horiontal line should only intersect the graph at 1 point
	* The functions $y = k, k \in \mathbb{R}$ and $f(x)$ should only have 1
	  solution for all $k$


== One to One Functions ==

*Definition*
* For all $a$ and $b$ where $a \neq b$, a one to one function satisfies the
  condition $f(a) \neq f(b)$
* To prove a function is not one to one, find one counterexample


*Proof*
* To prove a function $f(x)$ is one to one, prove the contrapositive of the
  definition
* Show that $f(x) = f(y)$ is simplifies to $x = y$


== Increasing and Decreasing Functions ==

*Increasing*
* Where $f(a) > f(b)$ for all $a > b$
* Implies that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$


*Decreasing*
* Where $f(a) < f(b)$ for all $a > b$
* Implies that $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x$


== Composite Functions ==

*Definition*
* A composite function is the combination of two or more functions


*Notation*
* Given the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, there are 2 possible composite
  functions
* These are notated as:
	* $f(g(x))$ or $g(f(x))$
	* $fg(x)$ or $gf(x)$
	* $f \circ g(x)$ or $g \circ f(x)$


*Example*
* Given the functions $f(x) = 3x + 4$ and $g(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$
* Implies that $f(g(x)) = \frac{3}{x^2} + 4$
* And that $g(f(x)) = \frac{1}{(3x + 4)^2}$


=== Domain and Range ===

* To find the domain and range of a composite function:
	* Combine the functions without simplifying
	* Find the domain and range of this combined function

*Beware*
* Beware of simplifying
* For example, given $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ and $g(x) = x^2$
* Find the domain and range of $g(f(x))$
	* Write out the composite function $g(f(x)) = (\sqrt{x})^2$
	* We should not simplify this to $g(f(x)) = x$
	* Domain is $x \geq 0$ and not $x \in \mathbb{R}$
	* Range is $y \geq 0$ and not $y \in \mathbb{R}$


*Defined*
* Given two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$
* The composition $f(g(x))$ is only defined if the range of $g(x)$ is a subset
  of the domain of $f(x)$
* If this is not the case, then the domain of $g(x)$ can be restricted to ensure
  this criteria
* The domain of $f(g(x))$ is either the same as the domain of $g(x)$, or a
  subset of it
* The range of $f(g(x))$ is either the same as the range of $f(x)$, or a subset
  of it


*Example*
* Given $f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 1}$ and $g(x) = x - 5$ find the domain and range
  of $f(g(x))$
	* The domain of $f(x)$ is $x \in \mathbb{R}, x \neq 1$
	* The range of $g(x)$ is $y \in \mathbb{R}$
	* The domain of $f(x)$ cannot cope with the output of $g(x)$
	* Hence we must restrict the domain of $g(x)$ to exclude 1 from its range
	* $g(x) = 1$ when $x = 6$
	* Hence the restricted domain for $g(x)$ is $x \in \mathbb{R}, x \neq 6$
	* The range will the the same as that of $f(x)$, which is
	  $y \in \mathbb{R}, y \neq 0$
* Alternatively:
	* $f(g(x)) = \frac{1}{x - 6}$
	* The domain is $x \in \mathbb{R}, x \neq 6$
	* The range is $y \in \mathbb{R}, y \neq 0$


== Decomposition ==

*Definition*
* Separate the function $f(x)$ into two functions $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ such that
  $f(x) = g(h(x))$


== Inverse Functions ==

*Definition*
* The inverse of a function reverses the mapping a function performs between its
  domain and range
* $f(f^{-1}(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$


*Notation*
* The inverse of $f(x)$ is written $f^{-1}(x)$


*Defined*
* The inverse of $f(x)$ is only defined if $f(x)$ is one to one
	* Otherwise the inverse will be a relation and not a function
* $f(x)$ must pass the horizontal line test


*Domain and Range*
* The domain of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the range of $f(x)$
* The range of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the domain of $f(x)$


*Finding Inverse*
* Write as $y = f(x)$
* Rearrange for $x$
	* Complete the square for quadratics
* Express as $f^{-1}(x) = ...$


*Graphical Relationship*
* The graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the graph of $f(x)$ reflected about the line
  $y = x$




= Remainder and Factor Theorem =

== Polynomial Division ==

*Proper and Improper Fractions*
* Given $f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$, where $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ are polynomials
* $f(x)$ is an improper fraction if the degree of $g(x)$ is greater than the
  degree of $h(x)$
* $f(x)$ is a proper fraction if the degree of $g(x)$ is less than the degree of
  $h(x)$


=== Algebraic Juggling ===

*Definition*
* Simplifies an improper fraction into a proper one
* Another method for performing polynomial division


*Process*
* Expand each term as a multiple of the denominator to remove it from the
  fraction
* Stop when we have a proper fraction remaining


*Example*

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2 + 3x + 4}{x + 4} & = \frac{x(x + 4) - 4x + 3x + 4}{x + 4} \\
& = \frac{x(x + 4) - x + 4}{x + 4} \\
& = x + \frac{-x + 4}{x + 4} \\
& = x + \frac{-(x + 4) + 4 + 4}{x + 4} \\
& = x - 1 + \frac{8}{x + 4} \\
\end{align*}
$$


== Remainder Theorem ==

* Given the polynomial $f(x)$
* The remainder when dividing $f(x)$ by $(x - a)$ is $f(a)$


*Example*
* Given $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 4$ and that we're dividing by $x + 4$
* The remainder will be $f(-4) = 8$
* Therefore $f(x) = (x + 4)(Q(x)) + 8$


=== Proof ===

* Given the polynomial $f(x)$
* $f(x)$ can be written as $f(x) = g(x)(x - a) + k, k \in \mathbb{R}$ for some
  other polynomial $g(x)$
* It follows that dividing $f(x)$ by $(x - a)$ will leave us with a remainder
  of $k$
* Consider $f(a) = g(a)(a - a) + k = k$
* Therefore $f(a)$ is the remainder of $f(x)$ when divided by $(x - a)$


== Factor Theorem ==

* $(x - a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$ if and only if $f(a) = 0$


=== Proof ===

* If $(x - a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided
  by $(x - a)$ will be 0
* By the remainder theorem, this implies $f(a) = 0$


== General Form ==

* The general form of the polynomial $f(x)$ is

$$
f(x) = (Q(x))(x - a) + f(a)
$$


== Solving Real Polynomials ==

*Goal*
* Express polynomial as a product of multiple linear factors
* Use null factor law to solve


*Factorisation*
* Find one root by guessing a range of values
	* Substitute a range of $x$ values into $f(x)$
	* Find a value of $x$ where $f(x) = 0$
	* $(x - a)$ is therefore a factor
* Divide $f(x)$ by $(x - a)$ using long division or algebraic juggling
* Repeat for quotient until we have a series of linear factors
* Watch out for simplifications
	* Common factor of $x$
	* Quadratics
	* Difference of perfect squares
