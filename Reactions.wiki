= Reactions =

*Definitions*
* System
	* All particles involved in the reaction
* Surroundings
	* Everything else


== Non-Reversible ==

{{$
\ce{CaCO3 + HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2}
}}$

* Reactants left of arrow
* Products right of arrow
* Forward reaction from left to right
* Reverse reaction from right to left
* Single arrow meaning reaction cannot be reversed
* Reaction proceeds to completion
	* All reactants converted to products


== Reversible ==

{{$
\ce{2NO2 <=> N2O4}
}}$

* Double arrow meaning reaction is reversible
* Never completes
* Mixture of reactants and products present at all times


== Ionic Equations ==

* Split aqueous compounds into ions
* Remove spectator ions (ones which remain aqueous on the right side of the
  equation)
* Example:
	* $\ce{2Na+ + SO4^{2-} + Ba^{2+} + 2NO3- -> 2Na+ + 2NO3- + BaSO4 (s)}$
	* Without spectator ions: $\ce{Ba^{2+} + SO4^{2-} -> BaSO4 (s)}$


== Acid Reactions ==

=== Acid Base ===

{{$
\ce{H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 -> BaSO4 (s) + 2H2O (l)} \\
\ce{H+ + OH- -> H2O (l)} \\
}}$

* Hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions
* Form water


=== Acid Metal ===

{{$
\ce{H2SO4 (aq) + Zn (s) -> ZnSO4 (aq) + H2 (g)}
}}$

* Solid metal and acid
* Form salt and hydrogen gas


=== Acid Carbonate ===

{{$
\ce{H2SO4 (aq) + CaCO3 (s) -> CaSO4 (aq) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l)}
}}$

* Carbonate and acid
* Form salt, carbon dioxide, and water


== Precipitation Reactions ==

{{$
\ce{Ba^{2+} + SO4^{2-} -> BaSO4 (s)}
}}$

* Two aqueous solutions
* When combined, a combination of ions forms a solid
* Causes the formation of a precipitate in the solution
