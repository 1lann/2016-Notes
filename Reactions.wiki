= Reactions =

== Non-Reversible ==

$$
\ce{CaCO3 + HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2}
$$

* Reactants left of arrow
* Products right of arrow
* Forward reaction from left to right
* Reverse reaction from right to left
* Single arrow meaning reaction cannot be reversed


== Reversible ==

$$
\ce{2NO2 <=> N2O4}
$$

* Double arrow meaning reaction is reversible
