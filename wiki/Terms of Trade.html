Decreased growth from major trading partners (China)

<ul>
<li>
Forecast for China's growth in 2016 is 6-7%, average over last decade is
	  10%

<li>
Decreases demand for our exports

<li>
Decreases their price

<ul>
<li>
Price for iron ore went from around $160 a tonne at the height of the
		  mining boom to $40 a tonne recently

</ul>
<li>
Decreases XPI

<li>
Causes unfavourable movement in TOT

</ul>
<li>
End of commodities price boom

<ul>
<li>
Price of iron ore dropping from 160 per tonne at height of boom to 40 a
	  tonne recently

</ul>
<li>
Productive capacity

<ul>
<li>
Due to the commodities price boom

<li>
Large increase in production capacity of commodities across the world

<ul>
<li>
Companies capitalising on high prices, aiming to increase profits

<li>
Eg. Brazil and Chile

</ul>
<li>
Increases supply of commodities in the market

<ul>
<li>
"Glut" in the market

<li>
Causes surplus of commodities

</ul>
<li>
Surplus is cleared through price mechanisms

<ul>
<li>
Decreases price

<p>
<span id="Terms of Trade-Factors Affecting-XPI-Diversification of Exports"></span><strong id="Diversification of Exports">Diversification of Exports</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Australia has low diversity in its exports

<ul>
<li>
We export predominantly raw minerals and agricultural products

<li>
Our top three exports are iron ore, coal, and natural gas

<ul>
<li>
Account for 37% of all exports

</ul>
<li>
A consequence of a decade long mining boom

</ul>
<li>
Decrease in the price of commodities has an amplified effect on the
  unfavourable movement in our TOT

<ul>
<li>
Because of our reliance on these exports

15 - 20 years ago, the emergence of China as a manufacturing powerhouse in the

Lead to large decline in the price of manufactured products

<li>
Decreased our MPI

</ul>
<li>

<span id="Terms of Trade-Effects-Balance of Goods and Services"></span><strong id="Balance of Goods and Services">Balance of Goods and Services</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An unfavourable movement may decrease the price of our exports

<li>
Due to the inelastic nature of Australia's exports

<ul>
<li>
Few substitutes due to the composition of our exports

<li>
Can't substitute raw minerals like iron ore

</ul>
<li>
Decreases export income

<li>
Unfavourable movement also may increase the price of our imports

<ul>
<li>
Causes a rise in the value of import spending

</ul>
<li>
BOGS moves towards a deficit

<span id="Terms of Trade-Effects-Current Account Deficit"></span><strong id="Current Account Deficit">Current Account Deficit</strong>

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Terms of Trade-Effects-Inflation"></span><strong id="Inflation">Inflation</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Falling export income (above) causes falling aggregate expenditure

<ul>
<li>
Decreases demand pull inflation

<li>
Decreases inflation rate

</ul>
<li>
However, if the MPI increases

<ul>
<li>
Increases costs for domestic businesses who must import intermediate goods
	  during the production of consumption goods

<li>
Increases cost push inflation

<li>
Increases inflation rate

<li>
This could be compounded by a depreciating dollar (caused by unfavourable
	  TOT movement)

<ul>
<li>
Further increases import prices and cost push inflation

<span id="Terms of Trade-Effects-Domestic Economic Growth"></span><strong id="Domestic Economic Growth">Domestic Economic Growth</strong>

Reduced economic growth results in an increase in cyclical unemployment

<ul>
<li>
Fall in derived demand for labour

<li>
May be offset slightly by a likely increase in employment from import
	  competing industries and industries that benefit from the depreciation of
	  the AUD (tourism and education)

<li>
Structural unemployment could occur in industries the falling XPI has severely
  affected

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Terms of Trade-Effects-Purchasing Power"></span><strong id="Purchasing Power">Purchasing Power</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unfavourable movement

<div id="Terms of Trade-Trade Balance"><h2 id="Trade Balance">Trade Balance</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
A favourable movement in the TOT should cause an increase in export income

<ul>
<li>
Due to the inelastic nature of Australia's exports

</ul>
<li>
A direct, positive, relationship between the TOT and BOGS

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Terms of Trade-Trade Balance-Negative Relationship"></span><strong id="Negative Relationship">Negative Relationship</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
There may be circumstances where this relationship doesn't hold

<ul>
<li>
Where there is an increase in XPI but a dramatic decrease in volume

<li>
Causes a decrease in value, and hence the BOGS

<li>
Rather than an increase in BOGS

</ul>
<li>
Natural disaster

<ul>
<li>
Severe reduction in export volume due to destruction of materials

<li>
Since price of exports is determined in the global market

<ul>
<li>
Australia has little individual influence over the price

</ul>
<li>
Price could still rise (favourable movement)

</ul>
<li>
Export capacity

<ul>
<li>
Price for exports is high due to high demand

<ul>
<li>
Since price is determined in the world market

</ul>
<li>
But there is a cap on the capacity of exports we can produce

<li>
If import prices are low at the same time

<li>
We may import a lot more than we export (trade deficit) while still
	  having a favourable terms of trade movement
