<div id="Foreign Investment-Investment and Savings Imbalance"><h2 id="Investment and Savings Imbalance">Investment and Savings Imbalance</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Australia has a large number of investment opportunities available

<ul>
<li>
Small population by world standards

<li>
Unable to raise enough savings to facilitate the development of the
	  economy through taking advantage of such opportunities

</ul>
<li>
Thus we spend more than our savings

<ul>
<li>
Leads to an investment and savings imbalance

<li>
We fund the difference by accessing the savings of other countries through
	  borrowing and the sale of Australian assets (equity transactions)

</ul>
<li>
Eg. in 2014

<ul>
<li>
Level of national investment was 27% of GDP

<li>
Level of national savings was 24% of GDP

<li>
Foreign investment as a result was roughly 3% of GDP

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Investment and Savings Imbalance-Benefits"></span><strong id="Benefits">Benefits</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This should not be viewed as a bad thing

<li>
Australia is still saving more than other countries

<ul>
<li>
22.3% of GDP in 2012

<li>
Average for the OECD member countries is 20.4% of GDP

</ul>
<li>
Drives economic growth through the development of infrastructure, expansion of
  labour force, research and development of new technologies, etc.

<ul>
<li>
Improves standard of living

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Investment and Savings Imbalance-Risks"></span><strong id="Risks">Risks</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the foreign funds are used to service existing debt, this is known as the
  "debt trap"

<ul>
<li>
The funds aren't invested into the economy to improve economic growth

</ul>
<li>
Unable to pay back the interest on debt

<ul>
<li>
Require additional international funds to service existing debt

</ul>
<li>
This is not a problem currently, as Australia's national income is growing
  at a faster rate than our national debt levels

<ul>
<li>
33% of foreign debt in 2014 was repaid within a year (debt turnover rate)

</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Foreign Investment-Balance of Payments"><h2 id="Balance of Payments">Balance of Payments</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
When a foreign investment is made into Australia

<li>
Australian dollars are demanded from the foreign exchange market, appreciating
  the exchange rate

<li>
Initial transaction is recorded as a credit in the financial account

<ul>
<li>
Increases the capital and financial account balance

</ul>
<li>
Interest repayments on borrowings, or dividend and profit payments are
  recorded as debits in the primary incomes category of the current account

<ul>
<li>
Increases current account deficit

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Balance of Payments-Aggregate Demand"></span><strong id="Aggregate Demand">Aggregate Demand</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In the short to medium term

<li>
As investment is a component of aggregate demand

<li>
Foreign investment into Australia increases aggregate demand

<li>
Increases consumption

<ul>
<li>
Increases consumer spending on imports

</ul>
<li>
Increases the demand from firms for intermediate capital goods

<ul>
<li>
Eg. machinery like trucks and drills for mining firms

<li>
Increases spending on imports

</ul>
<li>
Decreases balance of goods and services

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Balance of Payments-Productive Capacity"></span><strong id="Productive Capacity">Productive Capacity</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In the medium to long term

<li>
Increases productive capacity through investment in infrastructure, expansion
  of labour force, research and development into new technologies, etc.

<ul>
<li>
Eg. the Gorgon LNG gas project in the north of WA

</ul>
<li>
Increases export sales and export income

<li>
Increases balance of goods and services

<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Advantages-Access to Financial Capital"></span><strong id="Access to Financial Capital">Access to Financial Capital</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Given the investment and savings imbalance in Australia

<li>
Enabled the Australian economy to grow at a much faster rate than what it
  would have otherwise

<ul>
<li>
As it allows access to financial capital

</ul>
<li>
Allows for the development of a country's infrastructure

<ul>
<li>
Eg. Australia during mining boom, and our manufacturing industry

<li>
Eg. Gorgon LNG project in the north of WA

<li>
Increases productive capacity

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Advantages-Multiplier Effects"></span><strong id="Multiplier Effects">Multiplier Effects</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Causes a number of multiplier effects on the economy

<ul>
<li>
Where some industries benefit from strong growth in others

<li>
Eg. a manufacturer and repairer of truck parts would benefit greatly from
	  increased investment into the mining sector

<ul>
<li>
Due to the increase in derived demand for trucks and their repair

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Advantages-Aggregate Demand"></span><strong id="Aggregate Demand">Aggregate Demand</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Investment is a component of aggregate demand

<li>
Increases aggregate demand

<ul>
<li>
Increases economic activity, employment, and national income

<li>
Shifts the aggregate demand curve outwards

</ul>
<li>
Increases stock of physical capital like infrastructure (eg. building more
  factories)

<ul>
<li>
Increases the economy's productive capacity by increasing the capital to
	  labour ratio

<li>
Shifts the aggregate supply curve outwards

</ul>
<li>
Increases GDP

<li>
Improves standard of living

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Advantages-Technology and Managerial Experience"></span><strong id="Technology and Managerial Experience">Technology and Managerial Experience</strong>

<li>
Increases economic growth in the longer term

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Advantages-Finances the Current Account Deficit"></span><strong id="Finances the Current Account Deficit">Finances the Current Account Deficit</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Since the balance of payments must balance, the current account deficit must
  lead to a surplus on the capital and financial account

<li>
The capital and financial account surplus is primarily due to the import of
  large amounts of foreign financial capital in the financial account

<li>
Thus the current account deficit is financed through this foreign investment

<li>
Provides the funds required to purchase imports and sustain a high standard of
  living

<ul>
<li>
Since a BOGS deficit will contribute to the current account deficit, due
	  to the deficit on the primary incomes category

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Advantages-Tax Revenue"></span><strong id="Tax Revenue">Tax Revenue</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Increase in aggregate demand, development of infrastructure, growth in the
  economy

<li>
Increases tax revenue for the government due to the higher level of economic
  activity

<li>
Allows for the development of government run services (eg. police and fire
  departments, schools, healthcare)

<li>
Allows the government to service more of their debt

</ul>


<div id="Foreign Investment-Disadvantages"><h2 id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2></div>

<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Disadvantages-Foreign Ownership"></span><strong id="Foreign Ownership">Foreign Ownership</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Direct investment only

<li>
Direct investment involves the loss of control over an asset due to the
  transfer of ownership

<li>
Decision making can occur without consideration for Australia or the asset's
  corresponding industry

<ul>
<li>
Eg. the sale of land along the Great Barrier Reef to overseas investors,
	  who decide to develop the land into high volume tourist attractions

<li>
Lacks consideration for the local residents and for the reef itself

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Disadvantages-Speculative"></span><strong id="Speculative">Speculative</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Portfolio investment only

<li>
Portfolio investment contains all borrowings and equity transactions where
  less than 10% of ownership of an asset is transferred

<li>
The smaller size of some of these transactions suggests that they are short
  term and speculative

<ul>
<li>
Not productive based, don't benefit the economy in the long term

</ul>
<li>
Causes instability and volatility in the exchange rate

<ul>
<li>
Due to rapidly changing demand for the Australian dollar

<li>
Since every foreign investment requires the exchange of currency in the
	  foreign exchange market, influencing demand for the dollar

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Disadvantages-Shifting Operations Out of Australia"></span><strong id="Shifting Operations Out of Australia">Shifting Operations Out of Australia</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Direct investment only

<li>
The transfer of ownership of Australian firms to international investors can
  lead to the movement of certain operations offshore

<ul>
<li>
Labour may be cheaper, or infrastructure more developed in other countries

</ul>
<li>
Decreases domestic employment opportunities

<li>
Eg. Holden ceasing manufacturing operations in Australia in 2017

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Disadvantages-Transfer Pricing and Tax Avoidance"></span><strong id="Transfer Pricing and Tax Avoidance">Transfer Pricing and Tax Avoidance</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tax avoidance occurs when a multinational corporation sells a good to itself
  in another country with a lower corporate tax rate for virtually no profit
  (thus paying no tax), where it then sells the good on the international market
  (thus paying a lower tax rate)

<li>
Eg. Apple supposedly paying 0.7% tax on its Australian subsidiaries in 2014

<li>
This cheats the Australian government out of a large portion of tax revenue

<ul>
<li>
Reduces the government's income

<li>
Hinders the government's ability to fund the services it provides (eg.
	  police, firemen, hospitals, schools), and ability to service its debt

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Foreign Investment-Disadvantages-Flow of Income Out of Australia"></span><strong id="Flow of Income Out of Australia">Flow of Income Out of Australia</strong>
