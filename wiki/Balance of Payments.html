<span id="Balance of Payments-Trends in Current Account-Structural-Causes"></span><strong id="Causes">Causes</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Imbalance between level of national investment (spending money) and savings

<ul>
<li>
Small population in Australia

<li>
Savings pool that is inadequate to meet national investment needs

<li>
Numerous investment opportunities in Australia

<li>
High rate of investment

<li>
Invest more money than we save

<li>
Extra money invested (more than what we've saved) must come from somewhere

<li>
Must create a liability (eg. debt)

<li>
Liability comes from foreign investment

<ul>
<li>
Credit in financial account

<li>
Eg. borrowing money from international banks

</ul>
<li>
Since foreign investors require a return on investment, money must flow
	  out of Australia

<ul>
<li>
Debit in primary income

<li>
Eg. interest repayments on a loan

</ul>
<li>
Causes consistent deficit in primary income

<ul>
<li>
Since no real volatility in primary income debits

<p>
<span id="Balance of Payments-Trends in Current Account-Cyclic-Cause for BOGS Deficit"></span><strong id="Cause for BOGS Deficit">Cause for BOGS Deficit</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Australia has a high marinal propensity to import

<li>
Meaning value of imports are very dependent on Australian economic growth

<li>
Value of exports tied to world economic growth

<li>
Since Australia has had domestic growth larger than world growth over the past
  few years, we've imported more than we've exported

<li>
Rising Australian dollar over the last decade

<ul>
<li>
Decreased competitiveness of services sector

<li>
Reduced services exports

Supply for exports is relatively inelastic

Small changes in supply and demand have large changes in price

<div id="Balance of Payments-Why CAD is Good"><h2 id="Why CAD is Good">Why CAD is Good</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
CAD caused by imbalance between national levels of investment and saving

<li>
We are saving more than other countries

<ul>
<li>
22.3% of 2010-2012 GDP

<li>
Average of OECD countries is 20.4%

</ul>
<li>
Australia has many investment opportunities

<li>
Hence a large amount of money is spend on investment

<ul>
<li>
More than is saved

<li>
Financed by foreign investment

</ul>
<li>
Structural cause of CAD is repayments on investment in primary income account

<li>
CAD is financing investment activity and economic growth

<ul>
<li>
Hollistically viewed as a good thing

</ul>
<li>
Improves the country's economy

<li>
Generates future economic growth

<li>
Becomes a problem if debt isn't being spent on increasing national income

<ul>
<li>
As increasing debt causes increasing interest repayments

<li>
Eventually unable to pay back the interest on debt

<li>
Not a problem with Australia as national income increasing faster than the
	  rate debt has increased

<ul>
<li>
Debt has actually become easier to service despite growing so quickly

<li>
Ie. size of interest payments relative to income has decreased
