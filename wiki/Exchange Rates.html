<ul>
<li>
The price of one country's currency in terms of another country's currency

</ul>

<div id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Bilateral"><h3 id="Bilateral">Bilateral</h3></div>

<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Bilateral-Definition"></span><strong id="Definition">Definition</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The bilateral exchange rate measures the value of one country's currency in
  terms of another country's currency

<li>
Also called the cross exchange rate

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Bilateral-Example"></span><strong id="Example">Example</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For example, AUD in terms of USD

<ul>
<li>
1 AUD = 0.90 USD

<li>
1 USD = 0.71 British pounds

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Bilateral-Quoting"></span><strong id="Quoting">Quoting</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most commonly quoted exchange rate is the bilateral exchange rate against USD

<li>
There are two ways to quote a currency using the bilateral exchange rate:

<ul>
<li>
In terms of a country's purchasing power

<ul>
<li>
1 AUD = 0.75 USD

</ul>
<li>
In terms of a common currency

<ul>
<li>
1 USD = 1.33 AUD

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Trade Weighted Index"><h3 id="Trade Weighted Index">Trade Weighted Index</h3></div>

<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Trade Weighted Index-Definition"></span><strong id="Definition">Definition</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The trade weighted index is a measure of movements in the Australian dollar
  against a weighted average of 20 other currencies

<li>
The currencies are weighted according to their importance to Australia's
  international trade flows

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Trade Weighted Index-Advantages Over Bilateral Measure"></span><strong id="Advantages Over Bilateral Measure">Advantages Over Bilateral Measure</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
TWI is more accurate and more significant than the bilateral exchange rate
  holistically

<ul>
<li>
Though the bilateral rate is more significant for an individual travelling
	  to South Africa, for example

</ul>
<li>
As it is trade weighted, it relates to changes in performance of Australia's
  balance of payments over time

</ul>


<div id="Exchange Rates-Formula"><h2 id="Formula">Formula</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Price of good in foreign currency

<ul>
<li>
Multiply price of good in domestic currency by the bilateral rate, quoted
	  in terms of the domestic currency (ie. domestic currency is 1)

</ul>
<li>
Price of good in domestic currency

<ul>
<li>
Multiply price of good in foreign currency by the bilateral rate, quoted
	  in terms of the foreign currency (ie. foreign currency is 1)

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Formula-Example"></span><strong id="Example">Example</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Price in foreign currency

<ul>
<li>
Given a good costs $60 AUD

<li>
The exchange rate is 1 AUD = 0.75 USD

<li>
The good costs \(60 \times 0.75 = 45\) USD

</ul>
<li>
Price in domestic currency

<ul>
<li>
Given a good costs $80 USD

<li>
The exchange rate is 1 AUD = 0.75 USD

<li>
The exchange rate in terms of the USD is 1 USD = \(\frac{1}{0.75}\) = 1.33
	  AUD

<li>
The good costs \(80 \times 1.33 = 106.4\) AUD

</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Exchange Rates-Model"><h2 id="Model">Model</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand of the currency in the
  foreign exchange market

<li>
Whenever a firm or individual needs to move money into another country, it
  usually needs to convert the money into the country's currency

<ul>
<li>
This involves a transaction in the foreign exchange market

</ul>
<li>
All credits in the country's balance of payments represent demand for the
  currency

<ul>
<li>
A credit requires converting foreign currency into Australian dollars

<li>
This is a purchase of Australian dollars (ie. demand for it)

</ul>
<li>
All debits represent supply of the currency

<ul>
<li>
A debit requires converting Australian dollars into foreign currency to
	  perform a transaction overseas

<li>
This is the sale of Australian dollars (ie. supplying it to the market)

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Model-Increased Demand for the AUD"></span><strong id="Increased Demand for the AUD">Increased Demand for the AUD</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Increased demand for Australian exports

<ul>
<li>
Exports are sold in AUD

<li>
Overseas consumers require AUD to purchase the exports

<li>
These consumers must therefore purchase AUD (demand for the dollar)

<li>
Examples: purchase of iron ore, overseas students studying in
	  Australia, overseas tourists travelling to Australia

</ul>
<li>
Increased foreign investment into Australia

<ul>
<li>
Foreign investment in Australia requires AUD to perform domestic
	  transactions

<li>
Overseas investors must convert their money into AUD to perform these
	  transactions

<li>
Requires the purchase of AUD

<li>
Examples: construction of new mining infrastructure by an overseas
	  mining company in Australia

</ul>
<li>
Increased income receipts for Australians working overseas

<ul>
<li>
Australians are paid in AUD

<li>
Companies hiring Australians must convert the income for these employees
	  into AUD

<li>
Requires the purchase of AUD

</ul>
<li>
Increased dividend payments to Australians who have invested in overases
  companies

<ul>
<li>
Dividend payments must be converted to Australian dollars before being
	  paid to Australian investors

<li>
Requires purchasing AUD

</ul>
<li>
Increased profit flows to Australian companies with operations overseas

<ul>
<li>
Profit flows are converted to Australian dollars before being returned to
	  multinational companies with their headquaters in Australia

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Model-Increased Supply of the AUD"></span><strong id="Increased Supply of the AUD">Increased Supply of the AUD</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Increased spending on imports

<ul>
<li>
Imports in other countries are sold in that country's currency

<li>
Requires converting AUD into foreign currency

<li>
This is the sale of AUD in the foreign exchange market, suppling AUD to
	  the market

<li>
Examples: Purchase of cars from Japan, Australian tourists travelling
	  overseas, Australian students studying in overseas universities

</ul>
<li>
Increased foreign investment in other countries

<ul>
<li>
Transactions in foreign countries that arise from investment in those
	  countries take place in the foreign country's currency

<li>
Requires converting AUD into foreign currency

<li>
Examples: an Australian company building a manufacturing plant in China

</ul>
<li>
Increased income payments to overseas residents working in Australia

<ul>
<li>
Overseas residents are paid in their country's currency

<li>
Requires converting AUD to foreign currency

</ul>
<li>
Increased dividend payments to overseas investors who have invested in
  Australian companies

<ul>
<li>
Overseas investors expect to be paid in their country's currency

<li>
Requires converting AUD into foreign currency

</ul>
<li>
Increased profit flows to overseas companies with operations in Australia

<ul>
<li>
Overseas companies will convert profit made from operations in Australia
	  into the currency of the country the company's headquarters are in

<li>
Requires converting AUD into foreign currency

<ul>
<li>
Australian dollar is depreciating when looking at mid-term trends

<li>
Depreciating since 2012

<li>
Listed below in order of significance

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Terms of Trade"></span><strong id="Terms of Trade">Terms of Trade</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Recent unfavourable movement in the terms of trade since 2012

<li>
Especially from 2014 onwards where the world saw a large decrease in the price
  of commodities

<ul>
<li>
Indicated the end of the commodities price boom

</ul>
<li>
This caused a large decrease in the export price index

<li>
Caused a significant unfavourable movement in the terms of trade

<li>
Due to the inelasticity of our exports, this fall in price did not result in
  any significant change in volume sold

<ul>
<li>
Inelasticity due to the lack of available substitutes for our exports

<li>
Intrinsic to our exports due to their composition constisting primarily of
	  natural minerals

<ul>
<li>
Iron ore, coal, natural gas are our 3 largest exports

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
This decreased our export income

<ul>
<li>
Reduced demand for the AUD

<li>
Caused depreciation

</ul>
<li>
This is perhaps the most significant factor causing the depreciation over the
  last 4 years

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-World Economic Growth"></span><strong id="World Economic Growth">World Economic Growth</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Slowing growth from China over recent years

<ul>
<li>
Average growth over the past decade has been 10%

<li>
Forecasts for 2016 are 6 to 7%

</ul>
<li>
Since China is a major trading partner with Australia

<ul>
<li>
The number 1 consumer of Australian exports

<li>
The number 1 country that Australia imports from

</ul>
<li>
Decrease demand for Australian exports

<ul>
<li>
Decrease demand for AUD

<li>
Depreciation of AUD

</ul>
<li>
In addition, from 2014 onwards

<ul>
<li>
There has been a surplus in the supply of base metals, particularly iron
	  ore

<ul>
<li>
Due to large infrastruture investment during the mining boom riding on
		  the back of high commodity prices

<li>
Created large production capacity for commodities

</ul>
<li>
Since iron ore is Australia's number 1 export

<li>
This has dramatically reduced demand for Australia's exports

<li>
Decrease in demand for AUD

<li>
Caused depreciation in AUD

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Interest Rate Differential"></span><strong id="Interest Rate Differential">Interest Rate Differential</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Australia currently has a higher inflation rate relative to other countries

<li>
But we are in an expansionary phase of our monetary policy

<ul>
<li>
Reserve bank is in the process of reducing the cash rate

</ul>
<li>
This is reducing the return investors are receiving on their investments in
  Australia

<li>
Makes investors more likely to shift their holdings to overseas markets

<ul>
<li>
As other countries lift their cash rates

</ul>
<li>
This increases supply of the Australian dollar in the foreign exchange market,
  causing a depreciation

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-International Capital Flows and Foreign Investment"></span><strong id="International Capital Flows and Foreign Investment">International Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The stabilisation of key markets such as the US in 2013

<li>
Combined with slowing growth in the Australian economy due to the lower growth
  in important sectors such as mining

<li>
Caused investors to shift their holdings overseas

<ul>
<li>
To more attractive investment destinations

</ul>
<li>
Caused decreased direct and portfolio investment in Australia

<ul>
<li>
Decrease in demand for AUD

<li>
Causes a depreciation

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Relative Inflation Rate"></span><strong id="Relative Inflation Rate">Relative Inflation Rate</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Australia has benefitted from lower relative inflation rates over the previous
  two decades

<ul>
<li>
This increased the competitiveness of our exports

<li>
As the prices of our exports were lower when compared to countries with
	  higher inflation rates

<li>
This aided in appreciating our exchange rate during the mining boom

</ul>
<li>
Australia's inflation rate was 1.7% as of December 2015

<li>
Despite this being below the RBA's target inflation rate of between 2 and 3%

<li>
Most other trade competing nations have had similarly low levels of inflation

<ul>
<li>
European Union was 1.2% as of December 2015

</ul>
<li>
Hence the inflation rate has not been of major influence over the Australian
  dollar's depreciation recently

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Domestic Economic Growth"></span><strong id="Domestic Economic Growth">Domestic Economic Growth</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Australia has a high marginal propensity to import

<ul>
<li>
Meaning strong domestic growth directly correlates with higher spending on
	  imports

<li>
Increases supply of AUD

<li>
Causes depreciation

</ul>
<li>
As of December 2015, Australia's annual GDP growth rate was 3%

<ul>
<li>
Higher than expected

</ul>
<li>
Despite this, domestic growth is reasonably volatile

<li>
Does not have a large influence on the exchange rate

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Speculation"></span><strong id="Speculation">Speculation</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The exchange rate is significantly influenced by speculation on the part of
  investors in the short term

<li>
Since 2014, the improved performance of the US economy

<li>
Combined with the slowing growth of the Australian economy

<li>
Has seen demand for the AUD decrease as central banks around the world no
  longer view the AUD as an alternate, stable currency

<ul>
<li>
Other markets have better investment opportunities

</ul>
<li>
Causes depreciation

</ul>
