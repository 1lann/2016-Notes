<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Definition"></span><strong id="Definition">Definition</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The price of one country's currency in terms of another country's currency

<li>
Defined so that transactions can occur between countries

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Foreign Exchange Market"></span><strong id="Foreign Exchange Market">Foreign Exchange Market</strong>

<div id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Bilateral"><h3 id="Bilateral">Bilateral</h3></div>

<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Bilateral-Definition"></span><strong id="Definition">Definition</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The bilateral exchange rate measures the value of one country's currency in
  terms of another country's currency

<li>
Also called the cross exchange rate

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Bilateral-Example"></span><strong id="Example">Example</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For example, AUD in terms of USD

<ul>
<li>
1 AUD = 0.90 USD

<li>
1 USD = 0.71 British pounds

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Bilateral-Quoting"></span><strong id="Quoting">Quoting</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most commonly quoted exchange rate is the bilateral exchange rate against USD

<li>
There are two ways to quote a currency using the bilateral exchange rate:

<ul>
<li>
In terms of a country's purchasing power

<ul>
<li>
1 AUD = 0.75 USD

</ul>
<li>
In terms of a common currency

<ul>
<li>
1 USD = 1.33 AUD

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Trade Weighted Index"><h3 id="Trade Weighted Index">Trade Weighted Index</h3></div>

<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Trade Weighted Index-Definition"></span><strong id="Definition">Definition</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The trade weighted index is a measure of movements in the Australian dollar
  against a weighted average of 20 other currencies

<li>
The currencies are weighted according to their importance to Australia's
  international trade flows

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Measurements-Trade Weighted Index-Advantages Over Bilateral Measure"></span><strong id="Advantages Over Bilateral Measure">Advantages Over Bilateral Measure</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
TWI is more accurate and more significant than the bilateral exchange rate
  holistically

<ul>
<li>
Though the bilateral rate is more significant for an individual travelling
	  to South Africa, for example

</ul>
<li>
As it is trade weighted, it relates to changes in performance of Australia's
  balance of payments over time

</ul>


<div id="Exchange Rates-Formula"><h2 id="Formula">Formula</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Price of good in foreign currency

<ul>
<li>
Multiply price of good in domestic currency by the bilateral rate, quoted
	  in terms of the domestic currency (ie. domestic currency is 1)

</ul>
<li>
Price of good in domestic currency

<ul>
<li>
Multiply price of good in foreign currency by the bilateral rate, quoted
	  in terms of the foreign currency (ie. foreign currency is 1)

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Formula-Example"></span><strong id="Example">Example</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Price in foreign currency

<ul>
<li>
Given a good costs $60 AUD

<li>
The exchange rate is 1 AUD = 0.75 USD

<li>
The good costs \(60 \times 0.75 = 45\) USD

</ul>
<li>
Price in domestic currency

<ul>
<li>
Given a good costs $80 USD

<li>
The exchange rate is 1 AUD = 0.75 USD

<li>
The exchange rate in terms of the USD is 1 USD = \(\frac{1}{0.75}\) = 1.33
	  AUD

<li>
The good costs \(80 \times 1.33 = 106.4\) AUD

</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Exchange Rates-Model"><h2 id="Model">Model</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
The price of a currency is determined by the market forces of supply and
  demand in the foreign exchange market

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Model-Demand"></span><strong id="Demand">Demand</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In an international transaction where an international consumer wishes to buy
  an export produced by an Australian producer:

<ul>
<li>
The Australian producer will expect to be paid in Australian dollars

<li>
The international consumer will need to convert their country's currency
	  into Australian dollars

<li>
They will purchase Australian dollars on the foreign exchange market,
	  creating demand for AUD

<li>
The purchase of the export is a credit in Australia's BOP

<li>
Hence the credit in the BOP represents demand for AUD

</ul>
<li>
All credits in a country's BOP represent demand for the country's currency

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Model-Supply"></span><strong id="Supply">Supply</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In an international transaction where an Australian consumer wishes to buy an
  export produced by an international producer in another country:

<ul>
<li>
Producer will expect to be paid in their country's currency

<li>
Australian consumer will convert AUD into the foreign currency to purchase
	  the import

<li>
Supplies Australian dollars to the market

<li>
The purchase of an import is a debit in Australia's BOP

<li>
Hence the debit in the BOP represents supply of AUD

</ul>
<li>
All debits in a country's BOP represents supply of the country's currency

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Model-Increased Demand for the AUD"></span><strong id="Increased Demand for the AUD">Increased Demand for the AUD</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Increased demand for Australian exports

<ul>
<li>
Exports are sold in AUD

<li>
Overseas consumers require AUD to purchase the exports

<li>
These consumers must therefore purchase AUD (demand for the dollar)

<li>
Examples: purchase of iron ore, overseas students studying in
	  Australia, overseas tourists travelling to Australia

</ul>
<li>
Increased foreign investment into Australia

<ul>
<li>
Foreign investment in Australia requires AUD to perform domestic
	  transactions

<li>
Overseas investors must convert their money into AUD to perform these
	  transactions

<li>
Requires the purchase of AUD

<li>
Examples: construction of new mining infrastructure by an overseas
	  mining company in Australia

</ul>
<li>
Increased income receipts for Australians working overseas

<ul>
<li>
Australians are paid in AUD

<li>
Companies hiring Australians must convert the income for these employees
	  into AUD

<li>
Requires the purchase of AUD

</ul>
<li>
Increased dividend payments to Australians who have invested in overseas
  companies

<ul>
<li>
Dividend payments must be converted to Australian dollars before being
	  paid to Australian investors

<li>
Requires purchasing AUD

</ul>
<li>
Increased profit flows to Australian companies with operations overseas

<ul>
<li>
Profit flows are converted to Australian dollars before being returned to
	  multinational companies with their headquaters in Australia

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Model-Increased Supply of the AUD"></span><strong id="Increased Supply of the AUD">Increased Supply of the AUD</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Increased spending on imports

<ul>
<li>
Imports in other countries are sold in that country's currency

<li>
Requires converting AUD into foreign currency

<li>
This is the sale of AUD in the foreign exchange market, suppling AUD to
	  the market

<li>
Examples: Purchase of cars from Japan, Australian tourists travelling
	  overseas, Australian students studying in overseas universities

</ul>
<li>
Increased foreign investment in other countries

<ul>
<li>
Transactions in foreign countries that arise from investment in those
	  countries take place in the foreign country's currency

<li>
Requires converting AUD into foreign currency

<li>
Examples: an Australian company building a manufacturing plant in China

</ul>
<li>
Increased income payments to overseas residents working in Australia

<ul>
<li>
Overseas residents are paid in their country's currency

<li>
Requires converting AUD to foreign currency

</ul>
<li>
Increased dividend payments to overseas investors who have invested in
  Australian companies

<ul>
<li>
Overseas investors expect to be paid in their country's currency

<li>
Requires converting AUD into foreign currency

</ul>
<li>
Increased profit flows to overseas companies with operations in Australia

<ul>
<li>
Overseas companies will convert profit made from operations in Australia
	  into the currency of the country the company's headquarters are in

<li>
Requires converting AUD into foreign currency

<li>
Central bank may change the value they set the currency at

<ul>
<li>
Increasing the value of the currency is called a revaluation

<li>

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Types-Fixed-Disadvantages"></span><strong id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Requires repeated intervention by the central bank to adjust the exchange rate

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Where the value of a currency is allowed to fluctuate between an acceptable
  upper and lower limit in accordance with the market forces of demand and
  supply in the foreign exchange market

<li>
The country's central bank will intervene to prevent the currency from moving
  outside of these acceptable levels

<ul>
<li>
Can raise or lower interest rates

<li>
Or buy and sell large volumes of the currency to increase supply or demand

</ul>
<li>
Most countries use this system, albeit with a fairly large acceptable range

<ul>
<li>
Use its reserves of foreign currency to purchase a large amount of
	  Australian dollars

<ul>
<li>
Increases demand, causing an appreciation

</ul>
<li>
Increase interest rates

<ul>
<li>

<div id="Exchange Rates-Balance of Payments"><h2 id="Balance of Payments">Balance of Payments</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
A floating exchange rate causes a country's balance of payments to balance

<ul>
<li>
Current account and capital and financial account sum to 0

</ul>
<li>
Exchange rate varies to change the price of transactions in the balance of
  payments

<li>
For example:

<ul>
<li>
If there is an excess supply of AUD because of Australians purchasing a
	  large number of imports

<li>
Will cause a depreciation in the AUD

<li>
Raises the price of imports, decreasing demand for them

</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting"><h2 id="Factors Affecting">Factors Affecting</h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
Australian dollar is depreciating when looking at mid-term trends

<li>
Depreciating since 2012

<li>
Factors listed below in order of significance

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Terms of Trade"></span><strong id="Terms of Trade">Terms of Trade</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Recent unfavourable movement in the terms of trade since 2012

<li>
Especially from 2014 onwards where the world saw a large decrease in the price
  of commodities

<ul>
<li>
Indicated the end of the commodities price boom

</ul>
<li>
This caused a large decrease in the export price index

<li>
Caused a significant unfavourable movement in the terms of trade

<li>
Due to the inelasticity of our exports, this fall in price did not result in
  any significant change in volume sold

<ul>
<li>
Inelasticity due to the lack of available substitutes for our exports

<li>
Intrinsic to our exports due to their composition constisting primarily of
	  natural minerals

<ul>
<li>
Iron ore, coal, natural gas are our 3 largest exports

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
This decreased our export income

<ul>
<li>
Reduced demand for the AUD

<li>
Caused depreciation

</ul>
<li>
This is perhaps the most significant factor causing the depreciation over the
  last 4 years

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-World Economic Growth"></span><strong id="World Economic Growth">World Economic Growth</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Slowing growth from China over recent years

<ul>
<li>
Average growth over the past decade has been 10%

<li>
Forecasts for 2016 are 6 to 7%

</ul>
<li>
Since China is a major trading partner with Australia

<ul>
<li>
The number 1 consumer of Australian exports

<li>
The number 1 country that Australia imports from

</ul>
<li>
Decrease demand for Australian exports

<ul>
<li>
Decrease demand for AUD

<li>
Depreciation of AUD

</ul>
<li>
In addition, from 2014 onwards

<ul>
<li>
There has been a surplus in the supply of base metals, particularly iron
	  ore

<ul>
<li>
Due to large infrastruture investment during the mining boom riding on
		  the back of high commodity prices

<li>
Created large production capacity for commodities

</ul>
<li>
Since iron ore is Australia's number 1 export

<li>
This has dramatically reduced demand for Australia's exports

<li>
Decrease in demand for AUD

<li>
Caused depreciation in AUD

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Interest Rate Differential"></span><strong id="Interest Rate Differential">Interest Rate Differential</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Australia currently has a higher interest rate relative to other countries

<li>
But we are in an expansionary phase of our monetary policy

<ul>
<li>
Reserve bank is in the process of reducing the cash rate

</ul>
<li>
This is reducing the return investors are receiving on their investments in
  Australia

<li>
Makes investors more likely to shift their holdings to overseas markets

<ul>
<li>
As other countries lift their cash rates

</ul>
<li>
This increases supply of the Australian dollar in the foreign exchange market,
  causing a depreciation

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-International Capital Flows and Foreign Investment"></span><strong id="International Capital Flows and Foreign Investment">International Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The stabilisation of key markets such as the US in 2013

<li>
Combined with slowing growth in the Australian economy due to the lower growth
  in important sectors such as mining

<li>
Caused investors to shift their holdings overseas

<ul>
<li>
To more attractive investment destinations

</ul>
<li>
Caused decreased direct and portfolio investment in Australia

<ul>
<li>
Decrease in demand for AUD

<li>
Causes a depreciation

</ul>
<li>
Australian investors may also shift their investments overseas, rather than
  keep their holdings in Australia

<ul>
<li>
Supply Australian dollars to the market

<li>
Compound depreciation

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Relative Inflation Rate"></span><strong id="Relative Inflation Rate">Relative Inflation Rate</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Australia has benefitted from lower relative inflation rates over the previous
  two decades

<ul>
<li>
This increased the competitiveness of our exports

<li>
As the prices of our exports were lower when compared to countries with
	  higher inflation rates

<li>
This aided in appreciating our exchange rate during the mining boom

</ul>
<li>
Australia's inflation rate was 1.7% as of December 2015

<li>
Despite this being below the RBA's target inflation rate of between 2 and 3%

<li>
Most other trade competing nations have had similarly low levels of inflation

<ul>
<li>
European Union was 1.2% as of December 2015

</ul>
<li>
Hence the inflation rate has not been of major influence over the Australian
  dollar's depreciation recently

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Domestic Economic Growth"></span><strong id="Domestic Economic Growth">Domestic Economic Growth</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Australia has a high marginal propensity to import

<ul>
<li>
Meaning strong domestic growth directly correlates with higher spending on
	  imports

<li>
Increases supply of AUD

<li>
Causes depreciation

</ul>
<li>
As of December 2015, Australia's annual GDP growth rate was 3%

<ul>
<li>
Higher than expected

</ul>
<li>
Despite this, domestic growth is reasonably volatile

<li>
Does not have a large influence on the exchange rate

</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Factors Affecting-Speculation"></span><strong id="Speculation">Speculation</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The exchange rate is significantly influenced by speculation on the part of
  investors in the short term

<ul>
<li>
Daily turnover according to the RBA is $180 billion

<li>
Eighth largest market in the world

</ul>
<li>
Since 2013, the improved performance of the US economy

<li>
Combined with the slowing growth of the Australian economy

<li>
Has seen demand for the AUD decrease as central banks around the world no
  longer view the AUD as an alternate, stable currency

<ul>
<li>
Other markets have better investment opportunities

</ul>
<li>
Causes depreciation

</ul>


<div id="Exchange Rates-Effects"><h2 id="Effects">Effects</h2></div>

<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Effects-Exports"></span><strong id="Exports">Exports</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As dollar depreciates, international competitiveness of exporters improve

<ul>
<li>
Exports become cheaper for international consumers to buy

</ul>
<li>
Improvement in growth in export industries

<li>
Can cause structural change in economy

<ul>
<li>
For example, the conclusion of the mining boom (commodities price and TOT
	  boom) in 2012

<li>
Causing depreciation in Australian dollar

<li>
Impacts positively on other manufacturing and service providing industries

</ul>
<li>
For exporters whose contracts are denominated in foreign currency rather than
  Australian dollars

<ul>
<li>
Rather than changing the price of their exports

<li>
A depreciation increases their revenue when converted back into Australian
	  dollars

</ul>
<li>
May see the beginnings of the effects of Dutch disease

<ul>
<li>
Where displaced workers from the declining mining sector add to
	  unemployment

</ul>
<li>
Depreciation is generally good for exporters

<ul>
<li>
May be harmful if they must import intermediate goods

<li>
Depreciation will cause these to cost more

<li>
May eliminate any additional profit incurred from the depreciation

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Effects-Imports"></span><strong id="Imports">Imports</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
As the dollar depreciates

<li>
Imports become more expensive for Australian consumers

<li>
Increases the competitiveness of import-competing industries

<li>
Encourages substitution of imported products with locally made goods

<li>
Decreases import spending

<li>
For example, the tourism and education sectors

<ul>
<li>
People choosing to travel and study in Australia rather than overseas
	  because it's cheaper

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Effects-Balance of Goods and Services"></span><strong id="Balance of Goods and Services">Balance of Goods and Services</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Improvement in international competitiveness

<li>
Increase in export income

<ul>
<li>
After a time lag

<li>
As predicted by the J curve theory (??)

</ul>
<li>
Decrease in import spending

<li>
Balance of goods and services is expected to improve

<ul>
<li>
Move towards a surplus in the long term

</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<span id="Exchange Rates-Effects-Primary Income Category of Current Account"></span><strong id="Primary Income Category of Current Account">Primary Income Category of Current Account</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Depreciation makes foreign investment in Australia cheaper

<ul>
<li>
Australian assets are cheaper to purchase for overseas investors

</ul>
<li>
Greater foreign direct and portfolio investment will increase dividend
  payments and profit flows out of Australia

<ul>
<li>
In addition, since a significant portion of foreign debt (between 40 and
	  60%) is denominated in foreign currency

<li>
Increases size of interest payments

<li>
Known as the valuation effect

</ul>
<li>
Thus increases deficit in primary income category

<li>
This effect is pretty weak, as there are a lot of other factors that affect
  this deficit

Given tradables represent a signficant proportion of CPI

<li>
This could have a considerable impact on the inflation rate

<li>
In addition, increased input costs for domestic producers

<ul>
<li>
Due to higher prices of imported intermediate goods

<li>
Can also increase cost push inflation

</ul>
<li>
Increase in net exports and any multiplier effects can increase the price of
  non tradables and thus demand pull inflation

Explain the likely effects of this depreciation on the Australian economy
</p>


<p>
<span id="Example Essays-Effects-Essay"></span><strong id="Essay">Essay</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Exports

<ul>
<li>
Depreciation reduces price of exports for international consumers

<li>
Increases international competitiveness

<li>
After a time lag, this can result in the increase in sales of exports due
	  to the competitive advantage from a lower dollar

<ul>
<li>
J curve theory

</ul>
<li>
If the Australian producer imports intermediate goods in the production of
	  the final consumption good

<ul>
<li>
The depreciation will cause these imports to be more expensive

<li>
Increases costs for the business

<li>
May eliminate any profit incurred from a lower dollar

</ul>
<li>
Can cause structural change in the economy

<ul>
<li>
Conclusion of mining boom over recent years has seen the Australian
		  economy begin shifting towards the manufacturing and services sectors

<li>
Away from the mining sectors

<li>
Depreciation impacts positively on these other sectors

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Imports

<ul>
<li>
Depreciation increases the price of imports for Australian consumers in
	  Australian dollar terms

<li>
Decreases the demand for imports as they become more expensive

<li>
Decreases import spending

<li>
Bestows a competitive advantage on import competing industries

<ul>
<li>
Become comparatively cheaper

<li>
Increases growth in these industries

</ul>
<li>
For example, tourism

<ul>
<li>
Declining outbound tourist numbers as people chose to travel in
		  Australia instead

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
BOGS

<ul>
<li>
Increase in export income (credits)

<li>
Decrease in import spending (debits)

<li>
BOGS should move towards a surplus

<li>
After a time lag from J curve

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Foreign Debt

<ul>
<li>
Valuation effect

<li>
Denominated in foreign currencies

<li>
...

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Primary income

<ul>
<li>
Since a significant portion of Australia's foreign debt is denominated in
	  foreign currency (40 - 60%)

<li>
Depreciation immediately increases the size of this foreign debt in
	  Australian dollar terms

<li>
Increases the size of the interest repayments that must be paid

<li>
These interest payments are recorded as debits in the primary income
	  category of the current account

<li>
Increases the size of the deficit in the primary income account

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Current Account Deficit

<ul>
<li>
The goods and services category is roughly 4 times the size of the primary
	  income category

<li>
The effect of the exchange rate on the primary income is also relatively
	  weak, as there are many other factors that also influence it

<li>
This means that the CAD is likely to trend towards a surplus with the
	  improvement in the BOGS

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Domestic growth

<ul>
<li>
Lower import spending

<li>
Higher export income

<li>
Growth in import-competing industries

<li>
Larger aggregate expenditure

<li>
Two speed economy

<ul>
<li>
One sector growing much faster than another

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Inflation

<ul>
<li>
Increase in export income and decrease in import spending

<li>
Increases aggregate demand

<li>
Will increase demand pull inflation

<li>
In addition, higher import prices for intermediate goods will cost
	  producers more money

<ul>
<li>
Cost push inflation

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
Unemployment

<ul>
<li>
Increased domestic growth

<li>
Increase demand for labour

<li>
Cyclical unemployment should decrease

<li>
Structural changes in the economy can also cause structural unemployment

<ul>
<li>
Eg. Mining boom caused Australia's car manufacturing business to
		  suffer

<li>
Ford leaving Australia in 2016, Holden and Toyota 2017

</ul>
</ul>
