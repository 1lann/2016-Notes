<li>
In the above reaction:

<ul>
<li>
A high temperature would increase the proportion of particles with kinetic
	  energy greater than the activation energy, and increase the frequency of
	  collisions, increasing the rate of reaction

<li>
A low temperature would favour the forward exothermic reaction, resulting
	  in a higher yield

Since we have conflicting temperature requirements, a <em>moderate</em> temperature
