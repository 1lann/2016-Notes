= External Stability =

*Definition*
* The ability for a country to meet its financial obligations with the rest of
  the world


== Components ==

*Export Income*
* Export income is sufficient to finance import spending
	* CAD greater than 5% of GDP is considered unsustainable by the IMF
* With a CAD, the value of all debits is greater than the value of all credits
	* Spending more than we are earning
	* Can only be financed by creating a liability
	* This is only sustainable if we grow our income at a similar rate to which
	  total liabilities grow


*Foreign Debt*
* Managable level of foreign debt
	* Public sector debt greater than 50% of GDP considered unsustainable by the
	  IMF
* Public sector debt is seen as unproductive
	* As it usually finances necessary components of a government
		* But these components aren't productive for the economy
		* They don't generate output or drive economic growth
* Private sector debt is seen as positive
	* As it is usually used to grow a firm's productivity
	* Improves output and increases economic growth


*Exchange Rate*
* Stability in the exchange rate
	* A belief that the currency is stable




= Foreign Investment =

*Definition*
* Foreign investment is the stock of financial assets in Australia owned by
  foreign residents, and any financial transactions recorded in Australia's
  balance of payments that increase or decrease this stock


*Net Foreign Investment*
* Value of all investment into Australia subtract value of Australia's
  investment overseas


*Gross Foreign Investment*
* Value of all investment into Australia
* Ignores Australia's investment into the rest of the world


*Foreign Liabilities*
* Foreign liabilities are the stock of all assets owed to overseas entities
* Eg. borrowing money from overseas or selling Australian assets


*Foreign Assets*
* Foreign assets are the stock of assets we own in other countries
* Eg. purchasing an asset overseas


*Statistics*
* The stock of foreign investment in Australia was $2609.7 billion in June 2014
* The stock of Australian foreign investment abroad was $1745.5 billion in June
  2014
* Net foreign investment was thus $864 billion in June 2014
* Foreign investment has grown from 70% of GDP in 1990 to 160% of GDP in 2014
	* Grown from around $800 billion in 2000
	* To over $2600 billion in 2014
* Net foreign liabilities comprised of entirely foreign debt in 2014


== Classification ==

=== Type ===

==== Equity ====

*Definition*
* The sale of ownership of an Australian asset to an overseas resident
* Recorded in financial account


*Effects*
* Dividend payments and profit flows to overseas investors
	* Debit in the primary income category
	* Increases the current account deficit
* The issue of foreign ownership
	* Overseas corporations make decisions without consideration for
	  Australia's best interests
	* Little change in the level of foreign ownership of Australian assets over
	  the past decade
		* Mining industries have attracted a higher level of equity investment
	* Eg. tax avoidance
* Loss of share in future profits
	* By selling a part of an asset, you are giving up your share in any future
	  profits
	* Borrowing allows you to retain this privilege


==== Borrowing ====

*Definition*
* Foreign investment into Australia through the loaning of financial capital
  from an overseas entity
* Recorded in the financial account


*Effects*
* Interest repayments to overseas investors
	* Debit in the primary income category
	* Increases the current account deficit
* The issue of foreign debt


=== Size ===

* This method of classification is used in the financial account of the balance
  of payments


==== Direct ====

*Definition*
* Ownership of a significant controlling interest in an asset
* A significant controlling interest is defined as ownership of 10% or more of
  the asset
* Accounts for 26% of all foreign investment into Australia


*Forms*
* Land acquisition
* Share sales greater than 10%
* Establishment of a subsidiary
* Reinvestment of profits (no matter what size)


*Contents*
* Only contains equity transactions
	* All borrowings are classified as portfolio investment
	* As borrowing any amount of money never gives a significant controlling
	  interest in an asset


*Nature of Transactions*
* Value of transactions are often large
	* Usually used to create output and generate growth
	* Productive based, have a positive impact on the economy
* Dividend payments are usually quite stable
	* Due to size of initial transaction, signifying the likely long term nature
	  of the investment


*Effects*
* Dividend repayments and profit flows
* Issue of foreign ownership


==== Portfolio ====

*Definition*
* Ownership of less than 10% of an asset
	* Not a significant controlling interest
* Accounts for 56% of all foreign investment into Australia


*Forms*
* Share sales less than 10%
* All forms of borrowing
	* From banks, government securities, etc.


*Contents*
* Includes all borrowings
	* No matter how large the value of the transaction is
	* Since no amount of borrowing money can give a significant controlling
	  interest in an asset


*Nature of Transactions*
* Characteristically speculative and short term
	* Most business ventures funded by venture capital
		* Purchase of small amount of equity
		* Or borrowing money
	* Since most business ventures fail
	* Leads to volatility


== Countries and Industries ==

*Largest Investing Countries (2013 data)*
* United States (27%)
* United Kingdom (23%)
* Japan (5.3%)
* China is fastest growing, with growth of 967% between 2003 to 2013


*Largest Industries Invested In*
* Mining (37%)
* Manufacturing (14%)
* Finance and Insurance (11%)


*Sectors*
* Private sector (75%)
* Public sector (25%)


== Australia's Favourable Appearance to Investors ==

* Higher interest rate differential
	* 2% in December 2015
	* 4.5% in December 2011
	* Whereas US was 0.5% in December 2015
* Abundance of natural resources
	* Mining and agricultural
	* Top 3 exports are iron ore, coal, and natural gas
		* Account for 37% of all exports
* Consistent and strong economic growth
	* 3% December 2015
	* Decade average of 2.9%
* Political stability
	* Well developed and regulated financial markets
	* Offers a sense security for investors
* Excellent legal system
	* Ensures contracts will be enforced and disputes will be delt with equitably
	* Offers a sense of security for investors
* Skilled, productive labour force


== Investment and Savings Imbalance ==

* Australia has a large number of investment opportunities available
	* Small population by world standards
	* Unable to raise enough savings to facilitate the development of the
	  economy through taking advantage of such opportunities
* Thus we spend more than our savings
	* Leads to an investment and savings imbalance
	* We fund the difference by accessing the savings of other countries through
	  borrowing and the sale of Australian assets (equity transactions)
* Eg. in 2014
	* Level of national investment was 27% of GDP
	* Level of national savings was 24% of GDP
	* Foreign investment as a result was roughly 3% of GDP


*Benefits*
* This should not be viewed as a bad thing
* Australia is still saving more than other countries
	* 22.3% of GDP in 2012
	* Average for the OECD member countries is 20.4% of GDP
* Drives economic growth through the development of infrastructure, expansion of
  labour force, research and development of new technologies, etc.
	* Improves standard of living


*Risk*
* If the foreign funds are used to service existing debt, this is known as the
  "debt trap"
	* The funds aren't invested into the economy to improve economic growth
* Unable to pay back the interest on debt
	* Require additional international funds to service existing debt
* This is not a problem currently, as Australia's national income is growing
  at a faster rate than our national debt levels
	* 33% of foreign debt in 2014 was repaid within a year (debt turnover rate)


== Balance of Payments ==

* When a foreign investment is made into Australia
* Australian dollars are demanded from the foreign exchange market, appreciating
  the exchange rate
* Initial transaction is recorded as a credit in the financial account
	* Increases the capital and financial account balance
* Interest repayments on borrowings, or dividend and profit payments are
  recorded as debits in the primary incomes category of the current account
	* Increases current account deficit
* In the short to medium term:
	* Increases


*Aggregate Demand*
* In the short to medium term
* As investment is a component of aggregate demand
* Foreign investment into Australia increases aggregate demand
* Increases consumption
	* Increases consumer spending on imports
* Increases the demand from firms for intermediate capital goods
	* Eg. machinery like trucks and drills for mining firms
	* Increases spending on imports
* Decreases balance of goods and services


*Productive Capacity*
* In the medium to long term
* Increases productive capacity through investment in infrastructure, expansion
  of labour force, research and development into new technologies, etc.
	* Eg. the Gorgon LNG gas project in the north of WA
* Increases export sales and export income
* Increases balance of goods and services


== Advantages ==

*Access to Financial Capital*
* Given the investment and savings imbalance in Australia
* Enabled the Australian economy to grow at a much faster rate than what it
  would have otherwise
	* As it allows access to financial capital
* Allows for the development of a country's infrastructure
	* Eg. Australia during mining boom, and our manufacturing industry
	* Eg. Gorgon LNG project in the north of WA
	* Increases productive capacity


*Multiplier Effects*
* Causes a number of multiplier effects on the economy
	* Where some industries benefit from strong growth in others
	* Eg. a manufacturer and repairer of truck parts would benefit greatly from
	  increased investment into the mining sector
		* Due to the increase in derived demand for trucks and their repair


*Aggregate Demand*
* Investment is a component of aggregate demand
* Increases aggregate demand
	* Increases economic activity, employment, and national income
	* Shifts the aggregate demand curve outwards
* Increases stock of physical capital like infrastructure (eg. building more
  factories)
	* Increases the economy's productive capacity by increasing the capital to
	  labour ratio
	* Shifts the aggregate supply curve outwards
* Increases GDP
* Improves standard of living


*Technology and Managerial Experience*
* Direct investment only
* Results in the introduction of new managerial expertise and technical
  knowledge of industries
* Improves efficiency of Australian industries
* Improves our productivity, and thus our output
* Increases economic growth in the longer term


*Finances the Current Account Deficit*
* Since the balance of payments must balance, the current account deficit must
  lead to a surplus on the capital and financial account
* The capital and financial account surplus is primarily due to the import of
  large amounts of foreign financial capital in the financial account
* Thus the current account deficit is financed through this foreign investment
* Provides the funds required to purchase imports and sustain a high standard of
  living
	* Since a BOGS deficit will contribute to the current account deficit, due
	  to the deficit on the primary incomes category


*Tax Revenue*
* Increase in aggregate demand, development of infrastructure, growth in the
  economy
* Increases tax revenue for the government due to the higher level of economic
  activity
* Allows for the development of government run services (eg. police and fire
  departments, schools, healthcare)
* Allows the government to service more of their debt


== Disadvantages ==

*Foreign Ownership*
* Direct investment only
* Direct investment involves the loss of control over an asset due to the
  transfer of ownership
* Decision making can occur without consideration for Australia or the asset's
  corresponding industry
	* Eg. the sale of land along the Great Barrier Reef to overseas investors,
	  who decide to develop the land into high volume tourist attractions
	* Lacks consideration for the local residents and for the reef itself


*Speculative*
* Portfolio investment only
* Portfolio investment contains all borrowings and equity transactions where
  less than 10% of ownership of an asset is transferred
* The smaller size of some of these transactions suggests that they are short
  term and speculative
	* Not productive based, don't benefit the economy in the long term
* Causes instability and volatility in the exchange rate
	* Due to rapidly changing demand for the Australian dollar
	* Since every foreign investment requires the exchange of currency in the
	  foreign exchange market, influencing demand for the dollar


*Shifting Operations Out of Australia*
* Direct investment only
* The transfer of ownership of Australian firms to international investors can
  lead to the movement of certain operations offshore
	* Labour may be cheaper, or infrastructure more developed in other countries
* Decreases domestic employment opportunities
* Eg. Holden ceasing manufacturing operations in Australia in 2017


*Transfer Pricing and Tax Avoidance*
* Tax avoidance occurs when a multinational corporation sells a good to itself
  in another country with a lower corporate tax rate for virtually no profit
  (thus paying no tax), where it then sells the good on the international market
  (thus paying a lower tax rate)
* Eg. Apple supposedly paying 0.7% tax on its Australian subsidiaries in 2014
* This cheats the Australian government out of a large portion of tax revenue
	* Reduces the government's income
	* Hinders the government's ability to fund the services it provides (eg.
	  police, firemen, hospitals, schools), and ability to service its debt


*Flow of Income Out of Australia*
* Interest repayments from borrowings as well as profit and dividend flows from
  equity investments
* Contribute to the primary incomes deficit on the current account
* Increases the size of the current account deficit


*Structural Change*
* Heavy investment into particular areas over long periods of time can cause
  structural change in the economy
* Eg. mining boom
* Causes structural unemployment



= Foreign Debt =

*Gross Foreign Debt*
* Australia's total overseas borrowings


*Net Foreign Debt*
* Australia's total overseas borrowings subtract Australia's lending to
  international entities


*Private Sector Debt*
* Also called non-official sector
* Financial capital borrowed by private sector firms
* Typically seen as productive based, positive for the economy
	* Used to finance investment
* 74% of gross foreign debt in 2014 is attributed to the private sector


*Public Sector Debt*
* Also called official sector, government sector
* Financial capital borrowed by the government
* Typically seen as unproductive
	* Used to finance necessary government features like police and fire
	  departments
	* But do not contribute to economic growth
* 26% of gross foreign debt in 2014 is attributed to the public sector


*Trend*
* Foreign debt has been steadily increasing over the past 2 decades
	* 32% of GDP in 1990 to 55% of GDP in 2014
	* Caused by accumulation of debt over time due to continued current account
	  deficits caused by the investment and savings imbalance (described below)


== Foreign Liabilities ==

*Definition*
* A liability is a legal obligation for an entity to pay back something of value
  to another entity


*Foreign Liabilities*
* Foreign liabilities are things of value that are owed to entities outside the
  country in which they were bought
* Includes all investment which causes money to flow into Australia (credit in
  financial account)
	* Foreign borrowings (debt)
	* Sale of Australian assets to overseas investors


*Total Foreign Liabilities*
* The sum of all Australia's equity sales to overseas investors and borrowings
  from abroad
	* Equity plus borrowings
* Increased dramatically over past 2 decades
	* $366 million AUD in 1992
	* To $1006 billion AUD in 2014


*Net Foreign Liabilities*
* Total Australian liabilities subtract total Australian investment abroad
