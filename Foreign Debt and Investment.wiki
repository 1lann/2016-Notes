= External Stability =

*Definition*
* The ability for a country to meet its financial obligations with the rest of
  the world


== Components ==

*Export Income*
* Export income is sufficient to finance import spending
	* CAD greater than 5% of GDP is considered unsustainable by the IMF
* With a CAD, the value of all debits is greater than the value of all credits
	* Spending more than we are earning
	* Can only be financed by creating a liability
	* This is only sustainable if we grow our income at a similar rate to which
	  total liabilities grow


*Foreign Debt*
* Managable level of foreign debt
	* Public sector debt greater than 50% of GDP considered unsustainable by the
	  IMF
* Public sector debt is seen as unproductive
	* As it usually finances necessary components of a government
		* But these components aren't productive for the economy
		* They don't generate output or drive economic growth
* Private sector debt is seen as positive
	* As it is usually used to grow a firm's productivity
	* Improves output and increases economic growth


*Exchange Rate*
* Stability in the exchange rate
	* A belief that the currency is stable




= Foreign Investment =

*Definition*
* Foreign investment is the stock of financial assets in Australia owned by
  foreign residents, and financial transactions recorded in Australia's balance
  of payments that increase or decrease this stock


== Classification ==

=== Type ===

*Equity*
* The sale of ownership of an asset
* Recorded in financial account
* The sale of an Australian asset to an overseas investor is foreign investment
  into Australia
* Effects:
	* Dividend payments and profit flows to overseas investors
		* Debit in the primary income category
	* The issue of foreign ownership


*Borrowing*
* The loaning of financial capital from an overseas entity
* Recorded in the financial account
* Effects:
	* Interest repayments to overseas investors
		* Debit in the primary income category
	* The issue of foreign debt


=== Size ===

* This method of classification is used in the financial account of the balance
  of payments


*Direct*
* Ownership of a significant controlling interest in an asset
	* Significant controlling interest defined as ownership of 10% or more of
	  the asset
* Only contains equity transactions
	* All borrowings are classified as portfolio investment
	* As borrowing any amount of money never gives a significant controlling
	  interest in an asset
* Value of transactions are often large
	* Usually used to create output and generate growth
	* Productive based
	* Good for the economy
* Dividend payments are usually quite stable
	* Due to size of initial transaction
* Effects:
	* Dividend repayments and profit flows
		* Debit in the primary income category
	* Issue of foreign ownership


*Portfolio*
* Ownership of less than 10% of an asset
	* Not a significant controlling interest
* Includes all borrowings (no matter how large the value of the transaction is)
* Characteristically speculative and short term
	* Most business ventures funded by venture capital
		* Purchase of small amount of equity
		* Or borrowing money
	* Since most business ventures fail
	* Leads to volatility


*Comparison*
* Australians usually prefer borrowing over sale of equity
	* When equity is sold, you lose a share of the future profits
	* By borrowing, you still hold the right to a share of future profits


== Balance of Payments ==

*Financial Account*
* Balance on the financial account represents Australia's net investment
  transactions with the rest of the world
	* Total foreign investment into Australia, subtract Australia's investment
	  in foreign countries


== Causes ==

* Australia is a net importer of financial capital


=== Saving and Investment Imbalance ===




== Effects ==

=== Balance of Payments ===

*Pitchford Thesis*
* The surplus on the capital and financial account is derived from the
  international community's willingness to invest into Australia
* Creates a net liability for Australia, which must be repaid
	* Through dividends, profit flows, or interest repayments on borrowed funds
* These are all recorded as debits in the primary incomes category of the
  current account
* Causes the deficit on the current account


=== Productive Capacity ===

* As foreign investment into Australia increases:
	* Firms have more financial capital to increase their productive capacity
		* Through enhanced ability to construct infrastructure, expand labour
		  force, etc.
	* Increases export sales and thus national export income
	* Increases BOGS surplus in the long term
* This is a medium to long term effect


=== Aggregate Demand ===

* Foreign investment into Australia is a component of aggregate demand
* As foreign investment increases:
	* Increases aggregate demand
	* Increases consumer demand for imports
	* Increases demand from firms for intermediate capital goods
		* Further driven by increasing productive capacity, as outlined above
	* Increases import spending
	* Decrease BOGS surplus in the short term
* This is a short to medium term effect



== Advantages ==

=== Standard of Living ===


== Disadvantages ==



= Foreign Debt =

== Foreign Liabilities ==

*Definition*
* A liability is a legal obligation for an entity to pay back something of value
  to another entity


*Foreign Liabilities*
* Foreign liabilities are things of value that are owed to entities outside the
  country in which they were bought
* Includes all investment which causes money to flow into Australia (credit in
  financial account)
	* Foreign borrowings (debt)
	* Sale of an Australian asset to overseas investors


*Total Foreign Liabilities*
* The sum of all Australia's equity sales to overseas investors and borrowings
  from abroad
	* Equity plus borrowings
* Increased dramatically over past 2 decades
	* $366 million AUD in 1992
	* To $1006 billion AUD in 2014


*Net Foreign Liabilities*
* Total Australian liabilities subtract total Australian investment abroad




= Questions =

  and the factors that have caused this trend

  economy
