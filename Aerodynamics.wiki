= Fundamentals of a Gas =

== Properties ==

=== Pressure ===

$$
p = \frac{dF}{dA}
$$

*Definition*
* Force per unit area
* Force applied perpendicular to a tangent to the surface
	* Normal to the surface
* Symbol: $p$
* Units: Pascals (Pa)
	* Newtons per metre squared ($\mbox{N m}^{-2}$)


*Existence*
* Particles in gas or liquid
* Are moving, have a kinetic energy and a velocity
* Collide with object
* Transfer some momentum to the object
* Exert a force on the object


*Pressure at a Point*
* Imagine an area $dA$ around a point $B$ in a fluid
* The force exerted on this area is $dF$ due to collisions of particles in the
  fluid with the area
* The pressure of this area is $\frac{dF}{dA}$
* The pressure at point $B$ is $\lim_{dA \to 0} \frac{dF}{dA}$
* Intuition
	* Imagine a small box at point $B$ submerged in a fluid
	* There is a pressure exerted by the fluid on the walls of this box
	* Imagine the volume of the box approaching 0
	* The surface area of the box also approaches 0
	* The resultant pressure when the volume of the box is 0 is the pressure at
	  point $B$


=== Density ===

$$
\rho = \frac{dm}{dV}
$$

*Definition*
* Mass per unit volume
* Symbol: $\rho$
* Units: Kilograms per metre cubed ($\mbox{kg m}^{-3}$)

*Density at a Point*
* Imagine a cube of volume $dV$ around point $B$ in a fluid
* The matter inside this cube has a mass of $dm$
* The density at point $B$ is $\lim_{dV \to 0} \frac{dm}{dV}$


=== Specific Volume ===

$$
v = \frac{1}{\rho}
$$

*Definition*
* Volume per unit mass
* Symbol: $v$
* Units: $\mbox{m}^3\mbox{ kg}^{-1}$


=== Temperature ===

$$
E_K = \frac{3}{2}kT
$$

*Definition*
* Measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance
* Point property (like density and pressure)
* Symbol: $T$
* Units: Kelvin ($K$)


*Relation to Kinetic Energy*
* $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\mbox{ JK}^{-1}$
	* Boltzmann constant


=== Flow Velocity ===

* Vector quantity (direction and magnitude)
* Point property (like density and pressure)
* Symbol: $\vec{v}$
* Units: metres per second ($\mbox{ms}^{-1}$)


=== Streamline ===

* Path taken by a point flowing through a system


=== Flow Field ===

* Knowledge of $p$, $\rho$, $T$ and $\vec{v}$ at every point in a fluid system
* Defines a flow field


== Perfect Gas ==

*Definition*
* Gas where intermolecular forces between particles are negligible
* Such as air


== Equation of State ==

$$
\begin{align*}
p & = \rho R T \\
pv & = RT \\
\end{align*}
$$

Where:

* $p$ is pressure
* $\rho$ is density
* $v$ is specific volume
* $R$ is the specific gas constant
	* Different for every gas
	* Air: $287\mbox{ J kg}^{-1}\mbox{ K}^{-1}$




= Aircraft Anatomy =

== Axes ==

* Roll
	* Rotation around z axis (front to back)
	* Positive roll rotates the right wing down
* Pitch
	* Rotation around x axis (right to left)
	* Positive pitch rotates nose of plane up
* Yaw
	* Rotation around y axis (vertical)


== Components ==

* Fuselage
	* Main body of the aircraft
* Vertical stabiliser
	* Vertical tail at rear of aircraft
* Horizontal stabiliser
	* Horizontal tail extending off of vertical stabiliser


== Control Surfaces ==

*Flaps*
* Inner part of both wings, closer to the fuselage
* Extend horizontally to increase surface area of wing to increase lift
  force
* Some designs have extendible flaps on leading and trailing edges


*Ailerons*
* Horizontal control surfaces towards tips of wings
* Pivot up and down
* Controls roll
	* Deflect one side down, one side up
	* Generates more lift on side deflected down
	* Reduces lift on side deflected up
	* Rolls aircraft to one side


*Elevator*
* Horizontal control surfaces on trailing edge of horizontal stabiliser
* Pivot up and down
* Controls pitch
	* Deflect up or down
	* Reduces or generates lift over the surface
	* Increases or decreases pitch


*Rudder*
* Vertical control surface on trailing edge of vertical stabiliser
* Pivots side to side
* Controls yaw
	* Deflect left or right
	* Increases or decreases aerodynamic force on one side of the vertical
	  stabiliser
	* Rotates the plane around the y axis




= Aerodynamic Forces =

== Fundamentals ==

* Aerodynamic forces on an object in a fluid are a result of two factors
	* Pressure differences across the surface
	* Shear stress on the surface
* Net unbalance of force due to pressure applied at every point along the
  surface creates an aerodynamic force


*Shear Stress*
* Symbol: $\tau_w$
* Force applied on a surface with a direction that is tangental to the surface
  at the point it is applied
* Equivalent to friction
