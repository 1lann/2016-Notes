== Conjugate Acids and Bases ==

*Find Conjugate Acid/Base of Substance*
* Find the conjugate acid of a substance
	* Implies the substance is acting as a base
	* The substance will accept a proton
	* The answer will have one more proton
* Find the conjugate base of a substance
	* Implies the substance is acting as an acid
	* The substance will donate a proton
	* The answer will have one less proton
