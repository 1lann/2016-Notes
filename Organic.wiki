== Isomers ==

* Molecules with the same molecular formula but different physical structures
* To change one isomer into another, bonds must be broken


=== Structural Isomers ===

* Different physical sequence of atoms

*Examples*
* For $\ce{C4H10}$:
	* Butane
	* Methyl propane


=== Geometric Isomers ===

* Only for molecules with a double bond (alkenes)
* Different orientations of atoms around the double bond
	* Since no rotation can occur around the bond
* Only occurs when both carbon atoms in the double bond have 2 different
  elements off of them


*Naming*
* Cis isomers have the two identical atoms on the same side (top or bottom) of
  the carbon atoms they're attached to
* Trans isomers have the two identical atoms diagonally opposite each other


*Examples*
* Cis-but-2-ene
* Trans-but-2-ene
* 1,2-chloro trans-ethene


*Examples with No Geometric Isomerism*
* Ethene
* But-1-ene


== Saturation ==

* A compound is saturated if every carbon has 4 distinct bonds off of it
* Contain no double bonds
* Means compound must be an alkane
* Includes cyclic compounds


*Examples*

=== Oxidation Reaction ===

*Procedure*
* Oxidise by adding either:
	* Acidified permanganate ($\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{MnO4-}$)
	* Acidified dichromate ($\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$)
* Permanganate or dichromate will be reduced
	* $\ce{MnO4-}$ is reduced to $\ce{Mn^2+}$ ions
		* Turns from purple to pale pink
	* $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$ is reduced to $\ce{Cr^3+}$ ions
		* Turns from orange to deep green


*Primary Alcohol*
* From primary alcohol
	* To aldehyde (remove hydrogen)
	* To carboxylic acid (add oxygen)


*Secondary Alcohol*
* From secondary alcohol
	* To ketone (remove hydrogen)


*Tertiary Alcohol*
* Doesn't undergo any oxidation


*Differentiation of Alcohols*
* Add acidified permanganate or dichromate
* Will change color if primary or secondary alcohol
	* Permaganate: purple to pale pink
	* Dichromate: orange to deep green
* Add calcium carbonate
