= Organic =

* Organic compounds contain:
	* Only non-metal elements
	* A carbon atom


== Carbon Chain Length Prefix ==

1. meth-
2. eth-
3. prop-
4. but-
5. pent-
6. hex-
7. hept-
8. oct-
9. non-
10. dec-


== Alkanes ==

* Contain only carbon/carbon single bonds
* No double or triple bonds
* Formula: $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n + 2}}$
* Suffix: -ane


*Examples*
* Methane
* Ethane
* Butane


=== Substitution Reaction ===

* Only for alkanes
* Between alkane and halogen
* Replaces a hydrogen with a halogen atom
* Produces a halogen hydride


*Properties*
* Very slow reaction
* Sped up in the presence of UV light


*Multiple Substitutions*
* The reaction will continue over time until all hydrogens have been replaced
* Multiple hydrogen atoms will be replaced on the same molecule
* Naming:
	* Disubstitution: 2 hydrogen atoms replaced on a molecule
	* Trisubstitution: 3 hydrogen atoms replaced
	* Tetrasubstitution: 4 hydrogen atoms
	* Etc...


*Examples*
* Methane and chlorine (monosubstitution)
* Chloro-methane and chlorine (disubstitution)


== Alkenes ==

* Contain at least 1 carbon/carbon double bond
* No triple bonds
* Formula (for 1 double bond): $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n}}$
* Suffix: -ene


*Double Bond*
* No rotation around double bond


*Methene*
* Doesn't exist
* No two carbons available to form double bond


*Positioning*
* Position of double bond included in name
* Carbon atoms are numbered to minimise the position of the double bond


*Examples*
* Ethene
* Propene
* But-1-ene
* Cis-but-2-ene


=== Addition Reaction ===

* Only for alkenes
* Between alkene and halogen or hydrogen
* Only produces one organic product


*Procedure*
* Remove double bond
* Add halogen or hydrogen to both carbons that used to be doubly bonded


*Properties*
* Fast reaction
* No UV light needed


*Tricks*
* Bromine liquid is orange colour
* When added to alkene, turns colourless quickly
	* Since addition reaction proceeds quickly


*Examples*
* Ethene and bromine
* But-2-ene and fluorine
* Prop-1-ene and hydrogen


== Alkynes ==

* Contain at least 1 triple carbon/carbon bond
* Suffix: -yne


*Methyne*
* Doesn't exist
* Same reason as for methene above


*Examples*
* Ethyne
* But-2-yne


== Hydrocarbons ==

* Contain hydrogen and carbon only
* Obtained from crude oil
	* Separated by fractional distillation


=== Combustion Reaction ===

* All hydrocarbons burn in the presence of oxygen
* Exothermic reaction
* High activation energy
* Produces water and carbon dioxide


*Complete*

$$
\ce{CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O}
$$

* Occurs in excess oxygen
* Forms carbon dioxide


*Partial*

$$
\ce{CH4 + O2 -> CO + H2O}
$$

* Occurs when oxygen supply is limited
* Forms carbon monoxide (lethal to humans)


*Incomplete*

$$
\ce{CH4 + O2 -> C + 2H2O}
$$

* Occurs when oxygen supply is very limited
* Forms carbon


=== Fractional Distillation ===


== Halogens ==

* Act as hydrogens off carbon atoms
* Included in name of compound
* Parts included:
	* Location (carbon atom number)
	* Number of halogen
	* Type of halogen


*Location*
* Keeping the position of the double bond as low as possible takes priority over
  halogens when numbering carbon atoms
* For example:

IMAGE HERE

* Is 3-chloro propene, not chloro prop-2-ene


*Halogen Type*
* Fluorine: fluoro
* Chlorine: chloro
* Bromine: bromo
* Iodine: iodo


*Number of Halogens*
1. No suffix
2. Di-
3. Tri-
4. Tetra-


*Examples*
* Chloro methane
* Dichloro methane
* 1,2-dichloro ethene
* 1,1,2-trichloro 2-bromo propane


== Methyl Groups ==

* Extra carbon atoms extending off the longest chain
* Cannot exist off first or last carbon atom
	* Would form a longer chain
* Suffix: -yl


*Examples*
* Methyl propane
* 2,2-dimethyl butane
* 3-ethyl hexane


== Cyclic Compounds ==

* Carbon chain forms circle
* Prefix: cyclo-
* Formula: $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n}}$ (same as for alkenes)


*Examples*
* Cyclopropane
* Cyclobutane
* 1,2-dichloro cyclohexane
* Cyclobutene


== Isomers ==

* Molecules with the same molecular formula but different physical structures
* To change one isomer into another, bonds must be broken


=== Structural Isomers ===

* Different physical sequence of atoms

*Examples*
* For $\ce{C4H10}$:
	* Butane
	* Methyl propane


=== Geometric Isomers ===

* Only for molecules with a double bond (alkenes)
* Different orientations of atoms around the double bond
	* Since no rotation can occur around the bond
* Only occurs when both carbon atoms in the double bond have 2 different
  elements off of them


*Naming*
* Cis isomers have the two identical atoms on the same side (top or bottom) of
  the carbon atoms they're attached to
* Trans isomers have the two identical atoms diagonally opposite each other


*Examples*
* Cis-but-2-ene
* Trans-but-2-ene
* 1,2-chloro trans-ethene


*Examples with No Geometric Isomerism*
* Ethene
* But-1-ene


== Saturation ==

* A compound is saturated if every carbon has 4 distinct bonds off of it
* Contain no double bonds
* Means compound must be an alkane
* Includes cyclic compounds


*Examples*
* Saturated
	* Methane
	* 1,1-dichloro ethane
	* 1,3-difluoro Propane
* Unsaturated
	* Ethene
	* 1-bromo propene
