*Methene*
* Doesn't exist
* No two carbons available to form double bond


*Positioning*

TODO:


== Halogens ==

* Halogens can replace any hydrogen attached to a carbon in an organic molecule
* The position and type of halogen is included in the name of the molecule


*Location*
* The number of the carbon the halogen is attached to is used as its location
* When numbering the carbon atoms in the main carbon chain, minimising the
  position of the double bond takes priority over minimising the location of any
  halogens
	* For example, the following is 3-chloro propene, not chloro prop-2-ene:

IMAGE HERE


*Halogen Types*
* Fluorine: fluoro
* Chlorine: chloro
* Bromine: bromo
* Iodine: iodo


*Number of Halogens*

3. Tri-
4. Tetra-


*Examples*
* Chloro methane
* Dichloro methane
* 1,2-dichloro ethene
* 1,1,2-trichloro 2-bromo propane


== Alkyl Groups ==

* Alkyl groups are smaller carbon chains attached to a carbon on the longest
  chain
* An alkyl group cannot be attached to the first or last carbon on the longest
  chain
	* This would form a longer main chain, rather than an alkyl group
* The position and length of the chain is again included in the name
* Suffix: -yl


*Examples*

* Cyclobutane
* 1,2-dichloro cyclohexane
* Cyclobutene


== Isomers ==

* Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different physical
  structures
* To change one isomer into another, bonds in the molecule must be broken


=== Structural Isomers ===

* Different physical sequence of atoms

*Examples*
* For $\ce{C4H10}$:
	* Butane
	* Methyl propane


=== Geometric Isomers ===

* Geometric isomers only exist for molecules that contain a double bond (ie.
  alkenes)
* Since no rotation can occur around the double bond, a different arrangement of
  atoms around the double bond will form a new molecule
* Only occurs when both carbon atoms in the double bond have 2 different
  elements attached to them


*Naming*
* Cis isomer
	* The two top or bottom atoms of the two carbons attached by a double
	  bond are the same
* Trans isomer
	* The atoms diagonal of each other across the double bond are the same


*Examples*

* Trans-but-2-ene
* 1,2-chloro trans-ethene


*Examples with No Geometric Isomerism*

*Examples*
* Saturated
	* Methane
	* 1,1-dichloro ethane
	* 1,3-difluoro Propane
* Unsaturated
	* Ethene
	* 1-bromo propene




= Functional Groups =

== Alcohols ==

* Alcohols have an $\ce{OH}$ functional group attached to a carbon on the main
  chain
	* Also called a hydroxyl group
* The position of the $\ce{OH}$ takes highest priority in numbering the carbon
  atoms on the main chain
	* Higher priority than a double bond
* Suffix: -ol
* Formula: $\ce{R - OH}$
	* Where $R$ is an alkyl chain with at least 1 carbon


*Properties*
* Higher boiling points than alkanes with similar molar mass
	* Alcohols experience hydrogen bonding as a result of the hydroxyl group
	* Also have stronger dispersion forces due to the additional oxygen
* As carbon chain length increases, solubility of alcohols goes down
	* Dispersion forces become the predominant intermolecular force over
	  hydrogen bonding


*Examples*
* Ethanol
* Ethenol
* Butan-1-ol
* Cis-but-2-en-1-ol
* 3,4-diethyl cyclohexanol


=== Classification ===

*Primary Alcohol*
* The carbon that the hydroxyl group is attached to has 0 or 1 other carbon
  atoms attached to it
* Examples:
	* Methanol
	* Butan-1-ol


*Secondary Alcohol*
* The carbon that the hydroxyl group is attached to has 2 other carbon atoms
  attached to it
* Examples:
	* Butan-2-ol


*Tertiary Alcohol*
* The carbon that the hydroxyl group is attached to has 3 other carbon atoms
  attached to it
* Examples:
	* 2-methyl propan-2-ol


=== Isomers ===

* For a molecular formula containing an oxygen, there are multiple valid alcohol
  structures in addition to all the normal structural isomers
* There are no additional geometric isomers


*Example*
* For $\ce{C4H10O}$:
	* Butan-1-ol
	* Butan-2-ol
	* 2-methyl propan-1-ol
	* 2-methyl propan-2-ol


=== Hydration Reaction ===

* A hydration reaction occurs between alkenes and water


*Procedure*
* Replace the double bond with a single bond
* Add another hydrogen to one carbon
* Add an $\ce{OH}$ group to the other carbon
* Forms an alcohol


*Examples*
* Ethene and water, forms ethanol
	* $\ce{CH2CH2 + H2O -> CH3CH2OH}$


=== Oxidation Reaction ===

* The oxidation of an alcohol occurs between an alcohol and a solution
  containing $\ce{H+}$ ions
* The alcohol's classification determines how much oxidation an alcohol can
  undergo


*Procedure*
* An alcohol can be oxidised by adding it to a solution containing either of:
	* Acidified permanganate ($\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{MnO4-}$)
	* Acidified dichromate ($\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$)
* In this scenario, the permanganate or dichromate will be reduced
	* $\ce{MnO4-}$ will be reduced to $\ce{Mn^2+}$
		* Turns from purple to pale pink
	* $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$ will be reduced to $\ce{Cr^3+}$
		* Turns from orange to deep green
* The alcohol will be oxidised
	* Either a hydrogen will be removed, or an oxygen will be added to the
	  molecule


*Primary Alcohol*
* A primary alcohol can be oxidised twice
* First oxidisation will form an aldehyde (remove hydrogen)
* Second oxidisation will form a carboxylic acid (add oxygen)
* Primary alcohol to aldehyde to carboxylic acid
* If the oxidising agent is added in stoichiometric ratio, the result will be a
  mixture of aldehyde and carboxylic acid
* If excess oxidising agent is added, then all alcohol will oxidise into
  carboxylic acid
* Example:
	* Ethanol will form ethanal, then ethanoic acid
	* $\ce{CH3CH2OH -> CH3CHO -> CH3COOH}$


*Secondary Alcohol*
* A secondary alcohol can be oxidised once
* Will form a ketone (remove hydrogen)
* Secondary alcohol to ketone
* Example:
	* Propan-2-ol will form propan-2-one


*Tertiary Alcohol*
* Doesn't undergo any oxidation


*Differentiation of Alcohols*
* Add acidified permanganate or dichromate
* Will change color if primary or secondary alcohol
	* Permaganate: purple to pale pink
	* Dichromate: orange to deep green
* Add calcium carbonate
* Will fizz and produce carbon dioxide gas if a primary alcohol
	* Since carboxylic acid will be formed
* Can also fully oxidise a primary and secondary alcohol and then heat them
  using a bunsen burner
	* Carboxylic acid has a much higher boiling point than ketone due to
	  hydrogen bonding


== Aldehydes ==

* Suffix: -al
* Formula: $\ce{R - CHO}$
* Aldehyde group always attached to the terminal carbon
* The carbon that's part of the aldehyde group cannot be attached to another

* Ethanal
* Butanal
* Prop-2-enal


== Ketones ==

* Suffix: -one
* Formula: $\ce{R - CO - R'}$

* Butanone
* Pentan-3-one


== Carboxylic Acids ==

* Suffix: -oic acid
* Formula: $\ce{R - COOH}$
	* $R$ can be a hydrogen or an alkyl group
* Carboxylate group must be attached at the end of the main carbon chain
	* Similar to aldehydes
	* Carbon must not be double bonded
* Act as weak acids
	* Hydrogen on the end of the carboxylate group ionises


*Examples*
* Methanoic acid
* Ethanoic acid
* Pent-2-enoic acid


== Amines ==

* Suffix: -amine
* Formula: $\ce{R - NH2}$
	* $R$ must be an alkyl group (contain at least 1 carbon)
	* Can be anywhere on the carbon chain
* Numbering of amine group takes priority over other groups
* Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines exist
	* Only need to know about primary amines


*Properties*
* Lower boiling point than alcohols, but higher than hydrocarbons
	* Weaker hydrogen bonding than alcohols, since electronegativity of nitrogen
	  is less than that of oxygen
* Solubility decreases as carbon chain length increases
* Fishy smell
	* Pungent, like ammonia
* Solutions of amines act as bases
	* $\ce{CH3NH2 + H2O <=> CH3NH3+ + OH-}$

* Produces original alcohol and carboxylic acid
* $\ce{R - COO - R' ->[H+] R - COOH + R' - OH}$


*Base Procedure*
* Add a strong base
* Produces alcohol and salt of the carboxylic acid
	* For example, $\ce{NaOH}$ base will produce $\ce{NaCOO}$ (sodium
	  carboxylate), assuming the ester's carboxylic acid was methanoic acid
* $\ce{R - COO - R' ->[OH-] R - COO^- + R' - OH}$
	* $\ce{COO^-}$ combines with metal from base (eg. sodium) to form
	  $\ce{NaRCOO}$




= Polymerisation =

	* Use brackets to denote monomer unit


==== Polyethene ====

* Forms a very strong crystaline structure
	* Due to the strong dispersion forces between chains


*Low Density Polyethene*

* Causes amorphous regions where polymer chains can't pack together as tightly
  as in HDPE
	* Doesn't allow dispersion forces to act as strongly as in HDPE

* The sodium salt of a fatty acid is a solid and precipitates from the solution
* It is removed by filtration and used as soap


== Emulsification ==

* An emulsifying agent is a substance that forces two substances that usually
  remain separate to mix
	* Eg. forces oil and water to mix


*Process*
* The emulsifying agent consists of a molecule where
	* One part of the molecule is very soluble in the first substance
	* And the second part of the molecule is very soluble in the second
	  substance
* For example, a carboxyl ion with a very long carbon chain:
	* Long carbon chain is non polar
		* Hydrophobic (isn't soluble in water)
		* Soluble in fats
	* Carboxyl group at head of molecule is polar
		* Isn't soluble in fats or oils
		* Soluble in water
* Droplets of fats are surrounded by these emulsifying molecules with their non
  polar tails dissolved in the fat, and polar heads sticking out
	* Droplets now appear soluble in the water because they are surrounded by
	  the polar heads of the emulsifying molecules


*Soaps*
* Long carbon chain from fatty acid acts as the non polar tail
* Carboxyl functional group at head of molecule acts as polar head
* Allows fats to dissolve in water, washing them off dirty surfaces


*Solid Soap*
* Soap is made solid by forming ionic compounds using sodium or potassium ions
* When dissolved in water, the compound dissociates into its ions


== Scum ==

*Hard Water Areas*
* Hard water areas (like Perth) have $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ and $\ce{Mg^{2+}}$ ions in
  the water supply
* When things are washed with soap and left to dry, these form solid ionic
  compounds with the carboxyl ions
	* Called soap scum
* Leads to white residue on surfaces, stiff clothes, etc.


*Prevention*
* For places where everything must be very clean (eg. hospitals)
* Can soften the water
	* Use ion exchange resin
	* Removes $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ and $\ce{Mg^{2+}}$ ions


== Detergents ==

* Sulfonate group $\ce{SO3^-}$ used in place of carboxylic acid group
* Doesn't form scum


*Process*
* Concentrated sulfuric acid added to organic compound
* Adds sulfonate group to organic, producing water
* Organic ionises, $\ce{H+}$ from sulfonate group detaches
* Add strong base (eg. $\ce{NaOH}$) to neutralise $\ce{H+}$, producing water
* Forms sodium salt with the organic




= Biodiesel =

* Made from collected fats and oils from restaurants, etc.
	* Sunflower oil common


== Transesterification ==

{{$
\ce{R_1-COO-R_2 + R_3-OH <=>[OH-] R_1-COO-R_3 + R_2-OH}
}}$

* Take ester and alcohol
* React in the presence of a base
* Produces a different ester and alcohol
	* The alcohol's carbon chain is now the alcohol part of the original ester
	* The ester's alcohol part is the carbon chain on the original alcohol
	* The alcohol carbon chains have swapped


== Base Catalysed ==

*Process (Transesterification)*

{{$
\ce{\mbox{Triglyceride} + 3 R_1-OH <=>[OH-] 3 R_2-COO-R_1 + \mbox{Glycerol}}
}}$

* Take:
	* Fats (ie. triglyceride, triester composed of glycerol and 3 fatty acids)
	* Excess of a small alcohol (usually methanol)
* React in the presence of a base
* Form:
	* Glycerol
	* 3 separate esters, where the carboxylic acid part is the fatty acid from
	  the original ester, and the alcohol part is the carbon chain from the
	  small alcohol
* These 3 esters are the biodiesel


*Disadvantages*
* Glycerol is insoluble in the biodiesel
	* Forms a separate layer
	* Can be removed
* Glycerol is harmful to the engine, so if not removed properly, then the engine
  may be damaged


== Lipase Catalysed ==

*Process*

{{$
\ce{\mbox{Triglyceride} + 3 CH3COOCH3 <=>[\mbox{lipase}] 3 R_1COOCH3 + \mbox{Glycerol triacetate}}
}}$

* Take:
	* Fat (ie. triglyceride)
	* Excess of another ester (usually methyl ethanoate)
* React in the presence of lipase (an enzyme)
* Lipase cuts off and swaps the alcohol parts of each ester


*Advantages*
* Glycerol triacetate is soluble in the biodiesel
	* Doesn't need to be removed before using the biodiesel


*Equilibrium Considerations*
* Adding double the stoichiometric ratio of methanol or methyl ethanoate is
  enough to shift equilibrium far to the right to give an almost 100% yield of
  biodiesel

* Emulsifying property of soaps
	* Explain solubility
	* Long non-polar tail, polar carboxyl group head capable of accepting H
	  bonds
	* Long non-polar tail is only capable of bonding through dispersion forces.
	  Dispersion forces are not strong enough to compensate the energy required
	  to break the solvent/solvent bonds between water (H bonds), thus the
	  non-polar tail doesn't dissolve in water
	* The non-polar tail is capable of dissolving in fats and oils though,
	  because of its strong dispersion forces
	* The polar, H bonding head is capable of compensating the required energy
	  to break water's solvent/solvent bonds, and thus is able to dissolve in
	  water
	* Thus the long tail will dissolve in droplets of fats, with the polar head
	  exposed. This will surround droplets of fats, causing them to appear
	  soluble in water as they are surrounded by the soluble carboxyl heads of
	  the soap molecules
