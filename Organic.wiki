	* Acts as a catalyst


*Multiple Substitutions*
* The reaction will repeat itself over time until all hydrogens have been
  replaced by the halogen
* Multiple hydrogen atoms can be replaced on the same molecule
* Naming:
	* Disubstitution: 2 hydrogen atoms replaced on a single molecule
	* Trisubstitution: 3 hydrogen atoms replaced
	* Tetrasubstitution: 4 hydrogen atoms
	* Etc...

* Suffix: -en


*Double Bond*
* Parts of the molecule can't rotate around the double bond


*Methene*
* Doesn't exist
* No two carbons available to form double bond


*Positioning*
* Position of double bond included in name
* Carbon atoms are numbered to minimise the position of the double bond
* Minimising the location of the double bond takes priority over any halogens
  or alkyl groups attached to the main carbon chain


*Examples*

* But-1-ene
* Cis-but-2-ene


=== Addition Reaction ===

* Addition reactions are only between alkenes and a halogen or hydrogen

* Add a halogen or hydrogen to both carbons that used to be bonded by the double
  bond


*Properties*
* Fast reaction
* No UV light needed


*Tricks*
* Bromine is an orange coloured liquid at room temperature
* When added to an alkene, the solution turns colourless quickly
	* Since addition reaction proceeds quickly


*Examples*

* But-2-ene and fluorine
* Prop-1-ene and hydrogen


== Alkynes ==

* Alkynes contain at least 1 triple carbon/carbon bond
* Suffix: -yn
* The position of the triple bond is included in the molecule's name similar to
  the double bond on an alkene


*Methyne*

TODO:


== Halogens ==

* Halogens can replace any hydrogen attached to a carbon in an organic molecule
* The position and type of halogen is included in the name of the molecule


*Location*
* The number of the carbon the halogen is attached to is used as its location
* When numbering the carbon atoms in the main carbon chain, minimising the
  position of the double bond takes priority over minimising the location of any
  halogens
	* For example, the following is 3-chloro propene, not chloro prop-2-ene:

*Halogen Types*
* Fluorine: fluoro
* Chlorine: chloro
* Bromine: bromo
* Iodine: iodo


*Number of Halogens*
1. No suffix
2. Di-
3. Tri-
4. Tetra-


*Examples*
* Chloro methane
* Dichloro methane
* 1,2-dichloro ethene
* 1,1,2-trichloro 2-bromo propane


== Alkyl Groups ==

* Alkyl groups are smaller carbon chains attached to a carbon on the longest
  chain
* An alkyl group cannot be attached to the first or last carbon on the longest
  chain
	* This would form a longer main chain, rather than an alkyl group
* The position and length of the chain is again included in the name
* Suffix: -yl


*Examples*
* Methyl propane
* 2,2-dimethyl butane
* 3-ethyl hexane


== Cyclic Compounds ==

* Where the carbon chain forms a circle
* Can start numbering the carbon atoms from any carbon in the circle
* Prefix: cyclo-
* Formula: $\ce{C_{n}H_{2n}}$ (same as alkenes)


*Examples*
* Cyclopropane
* Cyclobutane
* 1,2-dichloro cyclohexane
* Cyclobutene


== Isomers ==

* Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different physical
  structures
* To change one isomer into another, bonds in the molecule must be broken


=== Structural Isomers ===

* Different physical sequence of atoms

*Examples*
* For $\ce{C4H10}$:
	* Butane
	* Methyl propane


=== Geometric Isomers ===

* Geometric isomers only exist for molecules that contain a double bond (ie.
  alkenes)
* Since no rotation can occur around the double bond, a different arrangement of
  atoms around the double bond will form a new molecule
* Only occurs when both carbon atoms in the double bond have 2 different
  elements attached to them


*Naming*
* Cis isomer
	* The two top or bottom atoms of the two carbons attached by a double
	  bond are the same
* Trans isomer
	* The atoms diagonal of each other across the double bond are the same



*Examples*
* Cis-but-2-ene
* Trans-but-2-ene
* 1,2-chloro trans-ethene


*Examples with No Geometric Isomerism*
* Ethene
* But-1-ene
* 2,2-chloro ethene


== Saturation ==

* A compound is saturated if every carbon has 4 other atoms attached to it
	* Ie. the molecule contains no double bonds
* Only alkenes are saturated
	* Includes cyclic alkenes


*Examples*
* Saturated
	* Methane
	* 1,1-dichloro ethane
	* 1,3-difluoro Propane
* Unsaturated
	* Ethene
	* 1-bromo propene


== Alcohols ==

* Alcohols have an $\ce{OH}$ functional group attached to a carbon on the main
  chain
	* Also called a hydroxyl group
* The position of the $\ce{OH}$ takes highest priority in numbering the carbon
  atoms on the main chain
	* Higher priority than a double bond
* Suffix: -ol
* Formula: $\ce{R - C - OH}$


*Properties*
* Higher boiling points than alkanes with similar molar mass
	* Alcohols experience hydrogen bonding as a result of the hydroxyl group
	* Also have stronger dispersion forces due to the additional oxygen
* As carbon chain length increases, solubility of alcohols goes down


*Examples*
* Ethanol
* Ethenol
* Butan-1-ol
* Cis-but-2-en-1-ol
* 3,4-diethyl cyclohexanol


=== Classification ===

*Primary Alcohol*
* The carbon that the hydroxyl group is attached to has 0 or 1 other carbon
  atoms attached to it
* Examples:
	* Methanol
	* Butan-1-ol


*Secondary Alcohol*
* The carbon that the hydroxyl group is attached to has 2 other carbon atoms
  attached to it
* Examples:
	* Butan-2-ol


*Tertiary Alcohol*
* The carbon that the hydroxyl group is attached to has 3 other carbon atoms
  attached to it
* Examples:
	* 2-methyl propan-2-ol


=== Isomers ===

* For a molecular formula containing an oxygen, there are multiple valid alcohol
  structures in addition to all the normal structural isomers
* There are no additional geometric isomers


*Example*
* For $\ce{C4H10O}$:
	* Butan-1-ol
	* Butan-2-ol
	* 2-methyl propan-1-ol
	* 2-methyl propan-2-ol


=== Hydration Reaction ===

* A hydration reaction occurs between alkenes and water


*Procedure*
* Replace the double bond with a single bond
* Add another hydrogen to one carbon
* Add an $\ce{OH}$ group to the other carbon
* Forms an alcohol


*Examples*
* Ethene and water, forms ethanol
	* $\ce{CH2CH2 + H2O -> CH3CH2OH}$


=== Oxidation Reaction ===

* The oxidation of an alcohol occurs between an alcohol and a solution
  containing $\ce{H+}$ ions
* The alcohol's classification determines how much oxidation an alochol can
  undergo


*Procedure*
* An alcohol can be oxidised by adding it to a solution containing either of:
	* Acidified permanganate ($\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{MnO4-}$)
	* Acidified dichromate ($\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$)
* In this scenario, the permanganate or dichromate will be reduced
	* $\ce{MnO4-}$ will be reduced to $\ce{Mn^2+}$
		* Turns from purple to pale pink
	* $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$ will be reduced to $\ce{Cr^3+}$
		* Turns from orange to deep green
* And the alcohol will be oxidised
	* Either a hydrogen will be removed, or an oxygen will be added to the
	  molecule


*Primary Alcohol*
* A primary alcohol can be oxidised twice
* First oxidisation will form an aldehyde (remove hydrogen)
* Second oxidisation will form a carboxylic acid (add oxygen)
* Primary alcohol to aldehyde to carboxylic acid
* Example:
	* Ethanol will form ethanal, then ethanoic acid
	* $\ce{CH3CH2OH -> CH3CHO -> CH3COOH}$


*Secondary Alcohol*
* A secondary alcohol can be oxidised once
* Will form a ketone (remove hydrogen)
* Secondary alcohol to ketone
* Example:
	* Propan-2-ol will form propan-2-one


*Tertiary Alcohol*
* Doesn't undergo any oxidation


*Differentiation of Alcohols*
* Add acidified permanganate or dichromate
* Will change color if primary or secondary alcohol
	* Permaganate: purple to pale pink
	* Dichromate: orange to deep green
* Add calcium carbonate
* Will fizz and produce carbon dioxide gas if a primary alcohol
	* Since carboxylic acid will be formed


== Aldehydes ==

* Suffix: -al
* Formula: $\ce{R - CHO}$
* Aldehyde group always attached to the terminal carbon
* The carbon that's part of the aldehyde group cannot be attached to another
  carbon using a double bond

*Examples*
* Ethanal
* Butanal
* Prop-2-enal


== Ketones ==

	* Hydrogen on the end of the carboxylate group ionises


*Examples*
* Methanoic acid
* Ethanoic acid

* An ester is a molecule comprised of an alcohol and carboxylic acid
* The name
* Suffix: -yl -oate
* Formula: $\ce{R - COO - R'}$
	* $R$ can be an alkyl group or hydrogen atom
	* $R'$ must be an alkyl group


*Formation*
* Mix a carboxylic acid and an alcohol with an $\ce{H+}$ ion catalyst (like
  $\ce{H2SO4}$)
* Produces an ester and water
* The reaction is an equilibrium


*Properties*
* Smell sweet or fruity

* $\ce{R - COO - R' -> R - COOH + R' - OH}$
	* $\ce{H+}$ ions act as catalyst


*Base Procedure*
* Add a strong base
* Produces alcohol and salt of the carboxylic acid
	* For example, $\ce{NaOH}$ base will produce $\ce{NaCOO}$ (sodium
	  carboxylate), assuming the ester's carboxylic acid was methanoic acid
* $\ce{R - COO - R' -> R - COO^- + R' - OH}$
	* $\ce{OH-}$ ions act as catalyst
	* $\ce{COO^-}$ combines with metal from base (eg. sodium) to form
	  $\ce{NaRCOO}$


== Amines ==

* Suffix: -amine
* Formula: $\ce{R - NH2}$
	* $R$ must be an alkyl group (contain at least 1 carbon)
	* Can be anywhere on the carbon chain
* Numbering of amine group takes priority over other groups
* Primary, secondary, and tertiary amines exist
	* Only need to know about primary amines


*Properties*

	* Weaker hydrogen bonding than alcohols, since electronegativity of nitrogen
	  is less than that of oxygen
* Solubility decreases as carbon chain length increases
* Fishy smell
	* Pungent, like ammonia

== Alpha Amino Acids ==

* Contain amine and carboxylic acid group on the terminal carbon

* Solid at room temperature
	* Relatively high melting and boiling points
* Relatively soluble in water


*Bonding*
* $\ce{H+}$ on carboxylic acid group is only weakly attracted to its oxygen
* Moves to $\ce{N}$ and forms an $\ce{NH3+}$ group, leaving a $\ce{COO-}$
  carboxylate group
* Called zwitterions
	* Positive charge on one part of the atom and a negative on another
* Ionically bond with other molecules
* Act as both the anion and cation
* Also exist in this state when dissolved in aqueous solution


== Polymerisation ==

* A polymer is a large molecule formed by the reaction of smaller monomers to
  form a long repeating chain


=== Addition Polymerisation ===

* Only for unsaturated molecules (ie. alkenes)
* The original molecule is called the monomer
* Multiple monomers react together to form a long polymer
* The double bond in the alkene breaks to form a single bond between a terminal
  carbon and another monomer
* The final polymer is named by prepending the prefix poly- to the name of the
  monomer


*Example*
* Polyethene from ethene
	* Monomer unit is ethene
	* Formed polymer is polyethene


==== Polyethene ====

*High Density Polyethene*
* Abbreviated as HDPE
* Comprised of lots of very linear polymer chains
* Forms a very strong crystaline structure
