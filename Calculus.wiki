= Integration =

Given the function:

{{$
f(x) = \frac{dy}{dx}
}}$

The integral of this function is $y$:

{{$
\int f(x) dx = y + c
}}$

Where $c$ is a real number.


== Properties ==

{{$
\begin{align*}
\int k f(x) dx & = k \int f(x) dx
\int (f(x) \pm g(x)) dx & = \int f(x) dx \pm \int g(x) dx \\
\int (f(x) g(x)) dx & = \int f(x) dx \int g(x) dx \\
\int (\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}) dx & = \frac{\int f(x) dx}{\int g(x) dx} \\
\end{align*}
}}$


== Polynomial Functions ==

Given the function:

{{$
f(x) = ax^n
}}$

The indefinite integral is:

{{$
\int f(x) dx = \frac{ax^{n + 1}}{n + 1} + c
}}$


*Procedure*
* Pick the main term (with the exponent) and ignore the coefficient
* Increase the power by 1
* Differentiate and observe the coefficient of this derivative
* Manipulate the original term with its increased exponent so that its
  coefficient when differentiated will produce the same coefficient as in the
  original function
	* Divide the original coefficient by the derivative's coefficient


*Examples*

{{$
\begin{align*}
\int 2x + 3x^2 dx & = x^2 + x^3 + c \\
\int x^2 + x^4 dx & = \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} + c \\
\int \frac{3}{x^2} dx & = \frac{-3}{x} + c \\
\end{align*}
}}$


*With Chain Rule*

{{$
\begin{align*}
\int 12x(x^2 + 3)^2 & = 2(x^2 + 3)^3 + c \\
\int (6x^2 + 8x)(x^3 + 2x^2 + 4)^2 & = \frac{2}{3}(x^3 + 2x^2 + 4)^3 \\
\end{align*}
}}$


*Expanding Brackets*
* If we're asked to integrate a composite function (eg. $12x(x^2 + 3)^4$)
* The coefficient out the front of the brackets must be a scalar multiple of
  the derivative of the function inside the brackets
* Otherwise we have to expand the brackets and integrate each term separately
* For example:
	* $12x(x^2 + 3)^4$ is doable
	* $(x^2 + 23)(x - 10)$ is not


== Exponential Functions ==

{{$

\begin{align*}
\int e^{2x} dx & = \frac{1}{2} e^{2x} + c \\
\int 4e^{3x + 1} dx & = \frac{4}{3} e^{3x + 1} + c \\
\end{align*}
}}$

required):

{{$
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
}}$

{{$
\begin{align*}
\int \sin{2x + 1} dx & = -\frac{1}{2}\cos{2x + 1} + c \\
\int 3\cos{5x} dx & = \frac{3}{5}\sin{5x} + c \\
\end{align*}
}}$


== Common Integrals ==

{{$
\begin{align*}
\int x^n dx & = \frac{x^{n + 1}}{n + 1} \\
\int \frac{1}{x^n} dx & = -\frac{n - 1}{x^{n - 1}} \\
\int e^x dx & = e^x \\
\end{align*}

  points

}}$


*Inscribed and Circumscribed Area*
* Value of an integral can be approximated by averaging the inscribed and
  circumscribed area
* Inscribed area is the area below the curve approximated with rectangles that
  do not extend above the curve
* Circumscribed area is area below the curve approximated with rectangles that
  extend above the curve
* Value will be between inscribed and circumscribed area


*Negative Area*
* Area below the x axis is negative, and above is positive
* If we're finding the area between two points, and the graph goes below the x
  axis
	* Then the portion under the x axis will cancel out with the portion above
	* Since it acts as a negative value
* To find the true area between a curve and the x axis
	* Either split the function up into sections where it intersects with the x
	  axis and negate the sections below the x axis
	* Or find the definite integral of the absolute value of the function


*Area Between Curves*
* Find the intersection between the curves
	* Equate the two equations and solve for $x$
* Area between the two curves is the area under the top curve subtract the area
  under the bottom one:

{{$
\int^b_a f(x) - \int^b_a g(x)
}}$

* Same equation applies even if part of the curve lies below the x axis
* If the upper graph becomes the lower graph between two intersections
	* Split up by finding the intersections between the two functions
	* Split the integral into multiple components and negate the opposing parts


*Find Integral from Derivative*
* Given the derivative for something involving product or quotient rule
