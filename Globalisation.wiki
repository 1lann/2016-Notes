= Globalisation =

*Definition*
* Nobel prize in economics Joseph Stiglitz
* The closer integration of countries and people bought about by the reduction
  in cost of transport and communication, and the breaking down of artificial
  barriers to the flow of goods, services, capital, knowledge, and people
  across borders
* Currently in 3rd wave of globalisation
	* Started in 1980s


== Causes ==

*Technology*
* Decreased cost of transportation
	* Standardisation of transportation systems
		* Containerisation
	* Through use of shipping containers
* Increased speed of transportation
	* Increased use of airplanes due to improvements in technology
	* Enabled faster deliveries
* Increased ease of international communication
	* Eg. email, instant messenger applications
	* Allows for coordination of international operations
		* Reduced delay
		* Increases efficiency and productivity
	* Allows for constant access to markets across all world timezones
		* "Eternal" market


*Government Policy*
* Opening of domestic markets to international producers
	* Through unilateral trade reform
* Reduced governmental assistance to firms
	* Reduction in "protection"
	* More level playing field for international producers
	* Improves efficiency in producing goods and services as businesses are
	  forced to compete


*Organisations*
* Organisations encouraging reduction in protection through:
	* Encouraging unilateral trade reform
	* Facilitating bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements
* Increase in free trade agreements could cause trade diversion rather than
  trade creation


*Multinational Corporations*
* Driven globalisation in an attempt to increase profit by reducing costs
* Evident through the processes of:
	* Outsourcing
		* Purchasing a good or service from another firm so we don't have to
		  manufacture/supply it ourselves
		* Eg. Coles outsourcing the design and production of their website to
		  Accenture Interactive, a digital marketing and customer experience
		  company
	* Offshoring
		* Moving operations to another country to reduce costs
		* Usually to reduce labour costs in manufacturing
		* Eg. Telstra moving their customer service department to India due to
		  cheaper labour
* Have established global brands, produced by global manufacturing processes,
  distributed by global networks


*Media*
* Global media networks transfer information and knowledge of other cultures to
  consumers in many countries
* Increases global awareness of popular culture
	* Caused by advertising, companies building global brands
	* Reinforced by tourism to other countries
* Influences consumers to want what the rest of the world has
	* Creates demand for international products
	* Eg. demand for American TV shows in Australia driving growth of online
	  television viewing sites such as Netflix


== Effects ==

*Positive*
* Access to wider variety of higher quality goods and service
	* Due to:
		* Increased imports from foreign countries
* Lowers prices
	* Decreases country's inflation rate
	* Increases consumers' real income
	* Increases consumer purchasing power
	* Due to:
		* Increased competition from international markets forcing firms to
		  remain competitive
		* Reduced cost of production due to cheaper international supply chains
* Provides more, better paying jobs
	* Increases real income
	* Increases standard of living
* Increases competition
	* Increases efficiency and productivity
	* Advances technology
* Reduces poverty
	* Creates jobs, increasing real income
	* Increased foreign direct investment in developing countries creates
	  economic growth, raising the standard of living
* Increases economic growth
	* Increased trade, job opportunities
	* Decreased prices
* Increases living standards
	* Increased real income of consumers
* International transfer of technology and knowledge
	* International labour force spreading skills
	* Multinational companies bringing their technology into new countries
* Increases multiculturalism
	* International labour force introducing variety of cultures to the rest of
	  the world
* Promotes world peace
	* War causes massive global economic destabilisation
	* As economies are interdependent, shocks propagate faster and are more
	  harmful


*Negative*
* Increases unemployment amongst low skill workers
	* Firms attempt to reduce costs by replacing low skill workers with
	  improved technology
* Increases structural unemployment due to rate of structural change
	* Rapid changes in global demand for goods and services
	* Causes firms to shift operations quickly (high rate of structural change)
	  to satisfy demand
	* Skill sets of workers become mismatched against the skill sets required by
	  firms
	* Increases unemployment
* Decreases wages of low skill workers
	* Low skilled workers easily replacable
	* Firms attempt to reduce costs by lowering wages and replacing workers if
	  needed
* Entrenches exploitation of child labour
	* Firms attempt to reduce costs
* Unfair to developing countries
	* Unable to compete effectively with large scale multinational corporations
	* Fail to produce competitive exports
	* Limits economic growth
* Volatile capital flow
	* Capital shifts between sectors quickly to accomodate changes in global
	  demand
	* Can destabilise developing economies
	* EXPLAIN MORE??
* Erosion of political sovereignty
	* Large corporations gaining political influence because of their large
	  economic influence
	* Create incentive for politicians to favour corporations over consumers
	  when making political decisions to maintain economic prosperity
* Economic shocks are contagious
	* Economic shocks propagate faster, cause more harm
	* Due to interdependent economies
	* Have severe destabilising effects (eg. GFC in 2008)
* Increased environmental damage and resource depletion
	* Due to increased industrialisation
* Destruction of local cultures
	* Large international consumers push local small businesses out of the
	  market

			* Eg. fuels like petrol or diesel
	* Perception of quality
		* Products of a higher perceived quality are more competitive


== Factors ==

*Productivity*
* Output (GDP, revenue) per unit of input (labour cost, labour time, material
  costs, capital costs)
* Higher productivity
	* Increases output per unit of input

* Lower wage rate
	* Decreases cost of production
	* Decreases prices of exports
	* Increases competitiveness


*Exchange Rate*
* Price of currency relative to another base currency (eg. $USD)
* Depreciation in dollar
	* Decreases price of exports relative to international consumers

== Measurements ==

*Real Unit Labour Costs*
* Wage rate divided by productivity
	* Higher wage rate increases real unit labour costs
	* Higher productivity decreases real unit labour costs
* Lower real unit labour costs
	* Decreases cost of production
		* Increased productivity, more output from same input
		* Decreased wages or time spent working, same output from less input
	* Decreases price of exports
	* Increases competitiveness
* Statistics
	* Decreased 6% since 2000
	* Increased Australia's competitiveness


*Trade Weighted Exchange Rate*
* Also known as "Trade Weighted Index"

* Statistics
	* Increased 57% since 2000




= Purchasing Power Parity =

*Definition*
* A good or service should cost the same amount in each country once converted
  to a common currency
* Measure to determine if a currency is over or undervalued


*Formula*
* Cost in country B (in country B's currency) divided by cost in country A (in
  country A's currency)
* Ratio greater than 1
	* Currency overvalued
* Ratio less than 1
	* Currency undervalued


== Disadvantages ==

* Not usually an accurate measurement of by how much a currency is over or
  undervalued
* Country may have introduced some other condition which drives up the price of
  the product
	* Eg. for hamburgers, a tariff on imported beef products would artificially
	  increase the price
