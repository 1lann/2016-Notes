= Globalisation =

*Definition*
* Nobel prize in economics Joseph Stiglitz
* The closer integration of countries and people bought about by the reduction
  in cost of transport and communication, and the breaking down of artificial
  barriers to the flow of goods, services, capital, knowledge, and people
  across borders
* Currently in 3rd wave of globalisation
	* Started in 1980s


== Causes ==

*Technology*
* Decreased cost of transportation
	* Standardisation of transportation systems
	* Through use of shipping containers
* Increased speed of transportation
	* Increased use of airplanes due to improvements in technology
	* Enabled faster deliveries
* Increased ease of international communication
	* Eg. email, instant messenger applications
	* Allows for coordination of international operations
	* Allows for constant access to markets across all world timezones


*Government Policy*
* Opening of domestic markets to international producers
	* Through unilateral trade reform
* Reduced governmental assistance to firms
	* Reduction in "protection"
	* More level playing field for international producers
	* Improves efficiency in producing goods and services as businesses are
	  forced to compete


*Organisations*
* Organisations encouraging reduction in protection through:
	* Encouraging unilateral trade reform
	* Facilitating bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements
* Increase in free trade agreements could cause trade diversion rather than
  trade creation


*Multinational Corporations*
* Driven globalisation in an attempt to increase profit by reducing costs
* Evident through the processes of:
	* Outsourcing
		* Purchasing a good or service from another firm so we don't have to
		  manufacture/supply it ourselves
	* Offshoring
		* Moving operations to another country to reduce costs
		* Usually to reduce labour costs in manufacturing
* Have established global brands, produced by global manufacturing processes,
  distributed by global networks


*Media*
* Global media networks transfer information and knowledge of other cultures to
  consumers in many countries
* Increases global awareness of popular culture
	* Reinforced by tourism to other countries
* Influences consumers to want what the rest of the world has
	* Creates demand for international products
* Enhances tolerance of other cultures (eg. tolerance for people of different
  races and religions)
* Decreases effects of cultural barriers (eg. language and customs)


== Effects ==

*Positive*
* Access to wider variety of higher quality goods and service
	* Due to:
		* Increased imports from foreign countries
* Lowers prices
	* Decreases country's inflation rate
	* Increases consumers' real income
	* Increases consumer purchasing power
	* Due to:
		* Increased competition from international markets forcing firms to
		  remain competitive
		* Reduced cost of production due to cheaper international supply chains
* Provides more, better paying jobs
	* Increases real income
	* Increases standard of living
* Increases competition
	* Increases efficiency and productivity
	* Advances technology
* Reduces poverty
	* Creates jobs, increasing real income
	* Increased foreign direct investment in developing countries creates
	  economic growth, raising the standard of living
* Increases economic growth
	* Increased trade, job opportunities
	* Decreased prices
* Increases living standards
	* Increased real income of consumers
* International transfer of technology and knowledge
	* International labour force spreading skills
	* Multinational companies bringing their technology into new countries
* Increases multiculturalism
	* International labour force introducing variety of cultures to the rest of
	  the world
* Promotes world peace
	* War causes massive global economic destabilisation
	* As economies are interdependent, shocks propagate faster and are more
	  harmful


*Negative*
* Increases unemployment amongst low skill workers
	* Firms attempt to reduce costs by replacing low skill workers with
	  improved technology
* Increases structural unemployment due to rate of structural change
	* Rapid changes in global demand for goods and services
	* Causes firms to shift operations quickly (high rate of structural change)
	  to satisfy demand
	* Skill sets of workers become mismatched against the skill sets required by
	  firms
	* Increases unemployment
* Entrenches exploitation of child labour
	* Firms attempt to reduce costs
* Decreases wages of low skill workers
	* Low skilled workers easily replacable
	* Firms attempt to reduce costs by lowering wages and replacing workers if
	  needed
* Unfair to developing countries
	* Unable to compete effectively with large scale multinational corporations
	* Fail to produce competitive exports
	* Limits economic growth
* Volatile capital flow
	* Capital shifts between sectors quickly to accomodate changes in global
	  demand
	* Can destabilise developing economies
	* EXPLAIN MORE??
* Economic shocks are contagious
	* Economic shocks propagate faster, cause more harm
	* Due to interdependent economies
	* Have severe destabilising effects (eg. GFC in 2008)
* Increased environmental damage and resource depletion
	* Due to increased industrialisation
* Erosion of political sovereignty
	* Large corporations gaining political influence because of their large
	  economic influence
	* Create incentive for politicians to favour corporations over consumers
	  when making political decisions to maintain economic prosperity

	  countries must be satisfied


== Strategic Trade Theory ==

* Government recognises challenges faced by smaller firms selling in
  international markets

*Comparative Advantage*
* When a country can produce a good or service at a relatively lower cost than
  another
	* Theoretically measured through opportunity cost

	* United States
	* Japan


=== Shift in Direction ===

*Shift*

  test of international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and expanding
  the real income of its people in the long term
* Test of international markets
	* Price
		* Cheaper products are more competitive
		* More important for homogenous (identical) products
			* Eg. fuels like petrol or diesel
	* Perception of quality
		* Products of a higher perceived quality are more competitive


== Factors ==

*Productivity*
* Output (GDP, revenue) per unit of input (labour cost, labour time, material
  costs, capital costs)
* Higher productivity
	* Increases output per unit of input
	* Decreases average cost
	* Decreases prices of exports
	* Increases competitiveness


*Inflation Rate*
* Percentage by which the price of goods and services in a country rise per
  year
* Lower inflation rate relative to other countries
	* Decreases prices of exports relative to other countries
	* Increases competitiveness


*Wage Rate*

	* Increases competitiveness


== Measurements ==

*Real Unit Labour Costs*
* Wage rate divided by productivity
	* Higher wage rate increases real unit labour costs
	* Higher productivity decreases real unit labour costs
* Lower real unit labour costs
	* Decreases cost of production
		* Increased productivity, more output from same input
		* Decreased wages or time spent working, same output from less input
	* Decreases price of exports
	* Increases competitiveness
* Statistics
	* Decreased 6% since 2000
	* Increased Australia's competitiveness


*Trade Weighted Exchange Rate*
* Also known as "Trade Weighted Index"
* Exchange rate relative to trading partners
* Lower trade weighted exchange rate
	* Decreased price of currency when converted to trading partners' currency
	* Decreased price of exports when converted to consumer's currency
	* Increases competitiveness
* Statistics
	* Increased 57% since 2000
	* Increased Australia's competitiveness




= Purchasing Power Parity =

*Definition*
* A good or service should cost the same amount in each country once converted
  to a common currency
* Measure to determine if a currency is over or undervalued


*Formula*
* Cost in country B (in country B's currency) divided by cost in country A (in
  country A's currency)
* Ratio greater than 1
	* Currency overvalued
* Ratio less than 1
	* Currency undervalued


== Disadvantages ==

* Not usually an accurate measurement of by how much a currency is over or
  undervalued
* Country may have introduced some other condition which drives up the price of
  the product
	* Eg. for hamburgers, a tariff on imported beef products would artificially
	  increase the price




= Balance of Payments =

*Definition*
* Systematic record of financial transactions between Australia and the world
* Measures movement of money across international borders
	* Not volume of goods, etc. but the money exchanged
	* Doesn't include domestic transactions

* Composed of two components
	* Current account (CAD)
	* Capital and financial account (KFAS)


*Credit*
* Transaction which causes money to flow into Australia
* Recorded as a positive value
* Eg. sale of a good (export), foreign investment into Australia


*Debit*
* Transaction which causes money to flow out of Australia
* Recorded as a negative value
* Eg. purchase of a good (import), foreign investments in other countries


*Balance*

== Structure ==

* Current account
	* Goods
	* Services

== Current Account ==

*Contents*
* Sections
	* Goods
	* Services
	* Primary income
	* Secondary income
* Transactions generally assumed to be concluded within one accounting period
	* Concluded meaning no further economic activity will result from the
	  transaction
	* Eg. purchase of car, no money flow after initial transaction
	* Eg. loan from bank, not concluded for much longer due to interest
	  repayments


*Goods*
* Largest section in currenct account
* Examples
	* Any exported or imported physical item
	* Eg. car, fridge, bicycle
* Volatile value
* Fluctuations in value caused by
	* High marginal propensity to import
	* Exogenous events like drought, terrorism, exchange rates, etc.


*Services*
* About 25% the size of the goods category
* Examples

		  school (eg. overseas university students) and pays Australian fees
		* Import/debit when an Australian student travels overseas to attend an
		  international university, and pays international fees
	* Tourism
		* Export/credit when someone overseas travels to Australia and spends
		  money
		* Import/debit when an Australian travels overseas and spends money
	* Freight, financial, insurance, telecommunications (call centres)
* Tends to be relatively stable
* Trending towards deficit in recent years
	* Due to appreciation of Australian dollar reducing international
	  competitiveness of tourism and education


*Primary Income*
* About 25% the size of goods
* Includes payment for use of another country's capital
* Examples
	* Interest payments on debt
		* Use of another country's financial capital

		  for
	* Profit flows
		* Profit made by companies paid into foreign countries (eg. for
		  international subsidiaries)
* Large deficit
	* Main cause of current account deficit
	* Large amount of debit transactions
	* Due to large foreign investment in Australia over the past decade, large
	  amounts are being paid back in interest payments


*Secondary Income*
* Relatively small size
* Includes one sided transactions in which nothing of economic value is received
  in return for payment
* Examples
	* Emergency relief
		* Cash payments after a natural disaster/terrorism act
	* Gifts/donations
	* Pensions
		* Eg. retired UK citizens now living in Australia receiving a pension
		  from the UK government


*Current Account Balance*
* All credits in current account plus all debits (where debits are negative)
* Usually a deficit
* CAD is current account deficit


*Other Balances*
* Merchandise balance
	* Exports of goods minus imports of goods
* Services balance
	* Exports of services minus imports of services
* Balance on goods and services (BOGS)
	* Exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services
* Income balance (net income)
	* Primary and secondary income credits minus debits
* Trade balance (net trade)
	* Exports of goods minus imports of goods
* Invisible trade balance (net invisible trade)
	* Services balance plus income balance
	* Excludes goods


== Capital and Financial Account ==

*Contents*
* Transactions that result in future financial flows in forthcoming accounting
  periods
	* Eg. loans from international banks where interest payments are paid across
	  a long period of time
* Sections
	* Capital account
	* Non-producible non-financial assets
	* Financial account
		* Direct investment flows
		* Portfolio investment flows
		* Reserve Bank flows
		* Other flows


*Capital Account*
* Relatively small (little economic effect)
* Capital transfers
* Examples
	* Foreign aid for fixed capital formation
		* Capital (eg. machinery, infrastructure) that cannot be converted into
		  cash easily
	* Capital transferred in and out of Australia by migrants
		* Eg. items in house


*Non-Producible Non-Financial Assets*
* Transactions in intellectual property
	* Copyright, patents, trademarks, franchises
* Examples
	* Harry Potter series movie rights
	* Star Wars franchise
* Patents
	* Protect inventor of new development from others stealing the idea once it
	  has been developed
	* As research and development is a risky investment (potentially no return)
	* Want to encourage it by ensuring companies can make a return on a new
	  technology without others stealing the market by stealing the technology
* Trademarks
	* Large subconsious effect, very valuable


*Financial Account*
* Largest category in capital and financial account surplus
	* Responsible for the surplus
* Includes all foreign investment
	* Direct investment
		* Investor purchases a significant controlling portion of an asset (>
		  10%)
		* Eg. share purchases, takeovers, subsidiaries, reinvestment of profits
	* Portfolio investment
		* Purchase of < 10% of an asset
		* Eg. purchase of shares, government bonds or other securities
	* International loans
		* Eg. loan from American bank to an Australian one
* Australia has accumulated a lot of foreign debt
	* 54% of Australian GDP (December 2014)
	* Large outflow in interest payments in primary income section in current
	  account
* Foreign investment in Australia also results in dividend and profit flows
  overseas
	* Also triggers large deficit through debits in primary income section


*Capital and Financial Account Balance*
* Balance on financial plus balance on capital account



== Balance ==

*Balance of Payments*
* Balance on current account plus balance on capital and financial account
* Should sum to 0 under a floating exchange rate


*Net Errors and Omissions*
* Balancing item
* Added so that the balance of payments sums to 0
* Accounts for any errors or omitted items in the transactions record


*Causes*
* Value of a currency (the exchange rate) always shifts to a new market
  equilibrium to ensure demand for the currency (credits on the balance of
  payments) equals supply (debits)
* Since credits will equal debits, the total of all transactions will sum to 0


*Usefulness*
* If the balance of payments always sums to 0, it is not of any use
* Trends in individual categories are of use
* Eg. a large surplus in the financial account indicates a large surge in
  foreign investment
	* Indicates growth in future economic activity


== Credits and Debits ==

*Credits*
* 4 types of current account credits
* Examples
	* Good: exporting iron ore
	* Service: exporting education services
	* Primary income: dividend on share purchased by foreign investor in an
	  Australian company
	* Secondary income: pension received from UK government for a retired UK
	  veteran


*Debits*
* 4 types of current account debits
* Examples
	* Good: importing cars
	* Services: import freight services to transport an export
	* Primary income: interest payment on a loan from an American bank
	* Secondary income: donation to international foreign aid program (eg.
	  private donation to world vision)


== Cross Account Effects ==

* Current account deficit
	* Leads to a capital and financial account surplus
	* Vice versa also true
* Increase in financial account surplus (foreign investment and debt)
	* Investors want a return on investment
	* Leads to larger deficit in primary income account due to interest
	  payments on loans and other outflows of capital gains (eg. profits and
	  dividends on shares)


== Trends in Current Account ==

*Factors*
* Structural
	* Remain relatively consistent despite changes in the economy
* Cyclic
	* Vary over time depending on state of economy (eg. in expansion or trough)


*Statistics*
* Average current account deficit
	* -4.5% of GDP over last 30 years
* Average balance of goods and services
	* -1.0% of GDP over last 30 years
* Average primary income
	* -3.5% of GDP over last 30 years


=== Structural ===

*Trends*
* Current account
	* Consistently a deficit (for over 2 decades)
* Primary income
	* Relatively stable, no large volatility
	* Consistently a deficit


*Causes*
* Imbalance between level of national investment (spending money) and savings
	* Invest more money than we save
	* Structural feature of Australian economy
	* Extra money invested (more than what we've saved) must come from somewhere
	* Must create a liability (eg. debt)
	* Liability comes from foreign investment
		* Credit in financial account
		* Eg. borrowing money from international banks
	* Since foreign investors require a return on investment, money must flow
	  out of Australia
		* Debit in primary income
		* Eg. interest repayments on a loan
	* Causes consistent deficit in primary income
		* Since no real volatility in primary income debits


*Cyclical Factors in Primary Income*
* Valuation effects
	* Exchange rates affect size of foreign interest repayments
	* Exchange rates are volatile, change depending on countrys' economies
	* Causes cyclic changes in primary income deficit
* Profitability of Australian businesses
	* Affects size of dividend repayments to overseas investors
	* Cyclical factor, changes depending on state of economy


=== Cyclic ===

*Trends*
* Current account
	* Large volatility over past decade
* Balance of goods and services (BOGS)
	* Large volatility
	* Caused mainly by goods (services much smaller)


*Cause for BOGS Deficit*
* Australia has a high marinal propensity to import
* Meaning value of imports are very dependent on Australian economic growth
* Value of exports tied to world economic growth
* Since Australia has had domestic growth larger than world growth over the past
  few years, we've imported more than we've exported
* Since services are a much smaller part of the BOGS
* BOGS has been a deficit


*Cause for Volatility in BOGS*
* Australia's largest exports are predominantly minerals and rural exports
* Such goods have few substitutes
* Meaning demand for goods is relatively inelastic
* Supply for exports is relatively inelastic
* Small changes in supply and demand have large changes in price
* Causes large volatility in value of goods


*Cyclical Causes*
* Terms of trade
	* Price of our exports
* Exchange rate
	* Affects price of exports relative to trading partners
* International business cycle
	* Affects volume of exports sold
* Domestic business cycle
	* Affects volume


== Government Impact on Current Account Deficit ==

*Macroeconomic policy*
* Fiscal policy
	* Reduce government budget deficit or increase budget surplus
	* Based on twin deficits hypothesis
* Monetary policy
	* Reduce inflation to increase competitiveness
	* Increases exports
	* Increases value of goods
	* Reduces current account deficit
* Microeconomic reform
	* Modify policies to increase efficiency
	* Reduce regulation


== Why CAD is Good ==

* CAD caused by imbalance between national levels of investment and saving
* We are saving more than other countries
	* 22.3% of 2010-2012 GDP
	* Average of OECD countries is 20.4%
* Australia has many investment opportunities
* Hence a large amount of money is spend on investment
	* More than is saved
	* Financed by foreign investment
* Structural cause of CAD is repayments on investment in primary income account
* CAD is financing investment activity and economic growth
	* Hollistically viewed as a good thing
* Improves the country's economy
* Generates future economic growth
* Becomes a problem if debt isn't being spent on increasing national income
	* As increasing debt causes increasing interest repayments
	* Eventually unable to pay back the interest on debt
	* Not a problem with Australia as national income increasing faster than the
	  rate debt has increased
		* Debt has actually become easier to service despite growing so quickly
		* Ie. size of interest payments relative to income has decreased
