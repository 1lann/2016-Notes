An enraptured smile gleams from high up there on the wood-clad stage, bowing and bowing as applause erupted through this cavernous interior. An expectant silence engrossed the hall as he sat quickly on that exquisite leather stool, behind an eclectic mix of ivory and stained maple. He adored the theatre of it all - sitting, elevated above a hopefully appreciative audience, who'd watch and wait with wide eyes as a pup would his food. He felt his concert suit brush lightly against his skin, his feet struggle against the excessively ornamented leather that enclosed them, his hair move slightly in the artificial eddy currents generated by the air conditioning. The audience faded from existence as the lights above them dimmed, and left nothing but him and his piano illuminated by a lone sun.

He caressed the opening octave of the Chopin, letting that solemn G echo throughout the hall as he looked to the heavens and smiled. The ensuing polyphony danced as it floated from the strings and into the vast surroundings, wrapping its silky appendages around the ears of its observers, drawing them closer to its delight and its wretched heartbreak. They marvelled at its sense of understanding of the human condition, at how it left them spiritually refined, yet emotionally bleeding. The chords, the harmonies, the countermelodies, it all gushed from his soul. For him, this music was a pure divinity expressed in the scratchings of a short-lived genius.

The audience, entranced by him and his Polish bride, seemed not to notice the subtle glow irradiating from the instrument. By the end of the exposition, it had intensified from a delicate shimmer to an inexplicable strangeness, casting playful shadows on the faces of those watching. The glow subsided as a final passage of thunderous chords proceeded a temporary etherial silence, broken by a violent explosion of wild applause. He leaped from his seat, the smell of sweat and varnish invading his senses. The black paint of the piano glistened in his eyes as he stepped forward to receive the exultant praise, bowing and bowing and bowing again and Bravo! and ecstatic whistling and cheering and enough to overwhelm him for all this life and the next.

He left the venue that night to the sound of more congratulations from a remaining few in the red-carpeted lobby. He wrapped his scarf tighter while walking across the sodden bricks up to Saint George's Terrace, the smell of maple still unremittingly clinging to his nose. The dreary concrete of the building fell behind him as he made his way deeper into the tangled mass of towers and roads and cars, behind the church, through a foetid alleyway permanently stained with the old smell of piss, all the way down Hay Street. It was almost silent if it weren't for the drunken calls and invasive hollers of the occasional dishevelled man. The excitement, the spectacle, the eminence was all gone now.

A car precipitated from nowhere, thundering past him with the rhythmic clatter of a dying engine. I hissed in his ear, jump! Jump now! Close, very close. How stupid of you. So stupid.

He furrowed his brow, shook his head, and kept walking.

-----

The pianist awoke the following morning to an urban din that invaded his disintegrating studio. It filtered in, seeping through the cracks in the walls like some toxic nuclear slime, irradiating him with corrosive reverberations. Car horns and slurred swears punctuated the restless air around him. Some incessant serpent residing behind his cochlea had hissed at him all night, rendering him incapable of sleep. Slowly rising from bed, he changed into something respectable and stepped out on to the street, trading the small, ill-lit room for the similarly claustrophobic pavement.

Attending a small café, he sat at a corner table with today's paper flayed out like an autopsied cadaver. He found the article he was looking for, and each word sent a blade stabbing at his heart. "Pallid, erratic and incoherent" [1]. He grew more irate with every sentence, his face more menacing with every letter, fists clenching with fury at whatever insolent fool dared to write such falsities. "Senseless ramblings" [2]. The ink screamed at him as he violently thrust the paper shut, slamming it on the small plastic table. "A travesty of piano art" [2].

He stood and walked along the footpath, watching the faces of those that passed him, who stared into the distance with the vacant eyes of a blind man. They all wore the same expression, the same dejected marks of woe. He detested them, these uncultured swine. Some of them only glance, but some now stare at him as he walks past, leering at him uninhibited, turning their heads as if to question his existence. Their necks inhumanly twist to follow him as he walked, as if made of rubber. Their faces began to grow pitiful, saddened, then angry, and started melting until these now grotesque creatures crawled past on all fours amongst a growing, infernal mass of prostrated bodies. His eyes darted back and forth between their faces, shooting ineffectual glances over his shoulder with rapid delusion.

Should I say it? Say what we're all thinking? You're thinking it too, right? You know what I'm going to suggest? They're monsters. And they're angry. Quick, that one! Over there! What's that? Why are they staring?

He sat on a nearby bench, forcing his face down into his hands and rubbing his forehead. This voice, this irrational Iago, was taunting him. He could feel it following him closely, ever and always whispering, engendering a sense of debilitating paranoia. His only liberty was to let it abate with time, all the while listening to the incessant chatter of what he now hoped were human passers-by, letting the rotten smell of concrete and piss and cigarette smoke engulf his olfactory senses.

The world eventually fell into a comparably eerie silence. He opened his eyes to see the expanse of a blue sky and his surroundings returned to him as normal. Timidly rising from the bench, he forced himself to continue about his day.

-----

He returned to the Concert Hall that evening, bitter with contempt, walking there amongst the subdued beating of light rain on cracked pavement. He entered the building through a pair of large glass doors, and slid his way into the mingling crowd. He was here to enjoy himself, to feel that immense wholesomeness from a passionate cello vibrato or blazing French horn - to merely listen, rather than entertain. He found himself a little more relaxed once invisible behind a group of boisterous casuals, hopefully evading that odious Mephistopheles he knew would be haunting the lobby.

Ah, David! I thought I'd find you here! A half-blind dog would never trust that counterfeit smile. Come to enjoy a bit of the Shostakovich? Now listen, I may have been a little harsh with my words, but I trust there's no animosity. Good, good. Ah, Gretchen! How nice to see you! And off he moved, never affording the opportunity for conversation, like some insipid creature determined to betray every soul he could possibly scratch with his stubbled claws.

I hissed and jeered in his ear. Something so intimate. So close. And they mock you. Your work. Your soul.

He took his seat in one of the thousand red velvet chairs and applauded as the conductor took his place on stage, raising the baton as silence fell. He felt the tumultuous vibrato of unison strings ricochet through his flesh as the opening theme fought its way into every crevasse in the hall, sweeping him away from this petty reality and into an unimaginable world of majestic Russian architecture. The walls around him melted into the fire and brimstone of Stalinist-era Leningrad that had inspired the work, lifting him from his seat into a transcendental realm of famine, propaganda, and deception. It all died away only with the closing trombone fanfare of the final movement, leaving him feeling complete.

He stopped for a small plastic cup of water before leaving, turning his back to the mass of people still exiting the hall. He could hear all sort of conversation, some enthusiastic, some critical, but most of it drivel. The sound of that jolly wretch caught his attention, shouting and laughing about all manner of things he planned to criticise in the following day's review.

Do it! I snapped. You know what would shut him up.

He shook his head violently, trying to free himself from whatever was taking over. He reached for another cup as the critic approached the water station. Oh yes, yesterday's recital! All that incestuous humming! Throughout the Chopin, no less! God, cats on a tin roof make a better noise than whatever that was.

He felt taunted, angry at the man's petulance, but seemingly incapable of any action or revenge, no matter how intensely desired it was.

It'll be easy. Trust me. I'll guide you. Just turn around. Move your feet forward toward him. That's it. Clench that venous fist.

The man laughed again, not recognising who was standing just in front of him, or what he was about to do. The flesh on his knuckles made contact with the critic's jaw, whose face twisted and rippled from the sudden force. He heard an explosive crack, seemingly coming from somewhere off in the distance, yet by the visible disfigurement in front of him he knew it was much closer. The man's eyes bulged in fright as his pretentious voice cut off mid sentence, yet all I could do was smile. Smile with a sense of sweet, psychopathic satisfaction.

-----



He fell to the floor and cried.
