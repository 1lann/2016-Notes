Aboriginal Stereotype
- Lazy, don't want to work
	- Sergeant: "Three healthy men bludging off you, too lazy to work"
- Uncivilised, unclean
	- Neville: "You're half way to civilising them"
- Neville: "The council's concerned that it's well away from any residences"
	- Neville: "Claims he wouldn't be able to go out and leave his wife
	  home alone at night"
	- Despite the fact that many are "generally down the Shamrock Hotel till
	  stumps"
		- How there are already many drunken people around due to the Hotel
		- Including the person who lodged the complaint
	- Highlights typical attitude of white Australians to Aboriginals

- Shown to be care for family (below)
- Resourceful
	- Milly: "then go down the dump an' see if you can find more tin for the
	  roof"
	- Milly: "What about a sheet of iron for the fireplace?", Jimmy: "Don't
	  worry, I know where I can get one."

		  excessive amount of work he'll have to do to get a lend of Skinny
		  Martin's cart

	- David: "Oh boy, I'm gonna have a swim", Milly: "No you ain't. Might be
	  bilbarl, dugaitj, anything down there"



Racism
- "unruly niggers" (Neal), "savages" (Neal)

- Joe: "Were a steadfast performance of duty ... With them, a reminder of the
  dangers they faced, the in the shape of three lorries carrying Aborigines"
	- Joe reading from a newspaper about Australia Day celebrations
	- Represents white Australia's attitude towards Aboriginals, that they are
	  a "danger"
	- Congratulates those who took them from their families
	- The triumphant narrative is disempowered by Joe's hesitant dictation
		- Symbolic of how such supposed "achievements" in the eyes of white
		  society have had devasating consequences for the oppressed
		  Aborigines, lacking in education, poor living conditions, etc
	- Further disempowered by Jimmy's angered outbursts
		- Jimmy: "Cause them bastards took our country"

- Milly to David: "Gimme that shirt, it's filthy"
- Gran: "Eh! Now you take them clothes down the soak, you 'ear me?"
- Milly: "What am I gonna wash with? How can I keep my kids clean and sen 'em
  to school?"
- Milly: "We takin' her to the doctor straight away" (Cissie's sick)
- Stage direction: "Cissie with the aid of a knife is looking for lice in
  David's hair"
	- One justification for removing Aboriginal children from their families
	  (the Stolen Generation) was to "improve [the] child's conditions of
	  living" (Peter Read, The Stolen Generations, 1981)
	- Davis contradicts the attitude held by white society at this time that
	  Aboriginal families were unable to provide adequate living conditions for
	  their children
	- Whole family insisting on cleanliness, Gran demanding it aggressively
	- Irony in removing soap from rations, then removing children from families
	  for squalid living conditions

- Sergeant: "Take it from me, I been dealin' with 'em for years. I got nothin'
  against 'em, but I know exactly what they're like"
	- Institutionalised racism
	- Irony of having "nothin' against 'em", yet objectifying them
	- Use of the pronoun "them"
		- Alienates Aboriginals as something other than human
		- Detrimentally stereotyping Aboriginals as a whole
- Sign (a prop): "Government of Western Australia, Fisheries, Forestry,
  Wildlife, and Aborigines"
	- Aboriginals listed as part of the flora and fauna
		- Subhuman
	- List appears in alphabetical order, yet "Aborigines" placed last
		- Even less significant than plants, trees and fish
- Jimmy yelling to Constable: "The roped off section for blackfellas. Al Jolson
  makin' out he was black, poor white bastard!"
	- Al Jolson in the movie The Jazz Singer from the 1920s
		- A white man playing a black character, coloured black using paint
	- Jimmy being sarcastic in expressing fake sympathy for Al Jolson for being
	  black
		- Recognises the inherent prejudice against Aboriginals
	- Highlights how Aboriginal people are aware of the racial prejudice that
	  exists in society and of their own marginalisation
- Frank: "He took me to his home and - " Justice of the peace: "His what?"
	- JP unable to comprehend an Aboriginal who might own a home
	- Stereotype that Aboriginals are poor, homeless, alocholics
- JP to Jimmy: "Shut up, you bloody idiot, or I'll charge you with contempt of
  court"
	- JP was sympathetic with Frank, "I understand the difficulty of the
	  situation you were in"
	- Terse and intolerant with Jimmy
	- JP to Jimmy: "You'll get your turn (to speak)", but never allows him,
	  hurries out instead since he's in a rush. Gives Frank a chance at an
	  explanation
- Sam: "Me gnoolya's (Jimmy, brother) better off than I am, bet he's not eating
  bread 'n fat for breakfast'"
	- Ironic, that even criminals in jail are looked after by the government
	  better than Aboriginals

- Constable: "Should put a pinch of strychnine (poison) in the flour"
	- Condoning genocide
	- Allusion to real life massacre
		- Strychnine used in the Bedford Downs masacre in 1924 to kill a group
		  of Aboriginal men for spearing a milk cow
	- Highlights how such acts are not merely jokes in a work of fiction, but
	  real life occurrences
- Sergeant: "Too late to adopt the Tasmanian solution"
	- "Tasmanian solution", allusion to a period of violent conflict between
	  British colonialists and Aboriginals, resulting in the near destruction
	  of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population
	- Ironic considering the Sergeant is the local protector of Aborigines, yet
	  jokes about genocide
	- To a modern audience, the use of the word "solution" recalls Hitler's
	  "final solution", the name given to the Nazi plan to exterminate all Jews
	  during World War 2
		- Evoke horror in audience at the severity of the Sergeant and the
		  Constable's racism

- Violent massacres
	- Billy, stage direction: "He grunts and mimes pulling a trigger"
		- Grunt, makes the action appear more animalistic and brutal
		- Dehumanises his attackers
	- Billy: "They chunk 'em on a big fire, chunk 'em in river"
		- No respect for their bodies or traditions, improper burial
		- Vestiges of colonialism still present in society some 50 years after
		  federation
	- Spiritually pollutes the area, Aboriginal people from their lose their
	  connection to the land, their heritage, their culture
		- Billy: "Not like my country, finish... finish"

- Juxtaposition of discussion of massacres
	- Neville giving an account of Governor Stirling's massacre in 1834
	- "The official estimate was fifteen to twenty dead, but only eight women
	  and several children were finally rounded up"
		- Gruesome account of the massacre
	- Stage direction: "He pauses and takes a drink of water"
		- Deliberate location of the stage direction
		- Such a description would command an appalled silence from the audience
		  in reflection
		- Very casual action, unware of his own hypocracy
		- Does not understand the significant horror behind Stirling's actions
		- Neville exposes honourable intentions gone so wrong
	- Tragically ironic considering his previous quote from Stirling's first
	  proclamation regarding the Aboriginals:
		- "Any person ... convicted of behaving in a cruel manner towards the
		   Aboriginal race ... will be prosecuted as if the same had been
		   committed against any others of His Majesty's subjects"
- In a 1990 production of No Sugar by Neil Armfield and Lynette Narkle
	- Proceeding Neville's speech was a "vibrant corroboree"
	- "visible layer of unsettled red dust marked his presence as incongruous,
	   invasive and ultimately illegitimate"

- Davis relies on historically accurate evidence
	- Chief protector Neville, Neal
	- The speach given by Neville to the WA Historical Society
- Used to authenticate the events in the play, and the experiences of the
  characters, projects the vile racism as a true feature of history

- Use of natives as a political tool to pander to voters
	- Neville: "Doctor Aberdeen examined the natives ... and found them to be '
	  rotten with scabies'"
		- Falsified doctor's report
		- Unbelievable for the audience, since Millimurras appear to take such
		  good care of themselves
		- Confirmed as a farce when Matron examines and finds 4 out of 89 have
		  scabies
	- Jimmy: "Wetjalas ... don't want us 'ere ... and old Jimmy Mitchell's tight
	  'coz they reckon Bert 'Awke's gonna give him a hidin' in the election"
		- Jimmy is politically savvy
		- Disregarded by policemen
			- Constable: "Bullshit", Sergeant: "Oh Jesus, shut up will youse?"
	- Neville moving natives at Northam to Government Well so James Mitchell
	  (whose constituency is Northam) can pander to voters in order to stay in
	  power
	- No voter backlash as Aboriginals are unable to vote
	- Demonstrates a complete disregard for the thousands of years of tradition
	  and connection the Aboriginal people have to their land

- Ration system
	- Designed to control and humiliate the Aboriginal people
	- Reflects the patronising attitude of the government

- Attempt to "civilise" natives
	- Ironic as those in charge of such stations are horribly abusive
		- Are completely uncivilised themselves in their methods of discipline
		- Mary: "He's always carryin' that cat-o'-nine tails and he'll use it,
		  too"
		- Stage directions: "Mary brings him tea on a tray. He leers at her
		  body"
			- Audience disgusted by his actions
	- Mary: "The boss's sons used to belt her up and, you know, force her ...
	  them trackers choked it dead and buried it in the pine plantation"
		- Death ceremonies associated with the death of people in Aboriginal
		  culture
		- Insulting, white culture blatantly ignoring such significance and
		  tradition in burying the baby amongst an imported species
	- Mary: "When Mr. Neal sends a girl to work at the hospital, it usually
	  means ... that he want's that girl... for himself"
		- Joe: "Filthy pig!" (referencing Neal)

- Neal: "He throws a stick of tobacco on the floor. Billy picks it up"
	- Treats natives as if they're dogs
	- Dehumanises them, demonstrates incredible racism
	- Neal to Billy: "I know that, you blithering stone-age idiot!"
		- "You bloody incompenent savage"
		- Billy humiliated
	- Neal's racism to Billy juxtaposed against Matron's humanity
		- Worsens Neal's racism
		- Matron: "Goodness me, what happened?" (first reaction is humility)
		- Neal (first reaction is anger): "Jesus, what hte bloody hell
		  happened?!"

- Church hymn sung by the children
	- "There is a happy land"
	- "Bright in that happy land, beams in every eye"
		- Presents an ideal version of unity, ignorant of the society they
		  live in
	- Children, innocence, naive to the irony of the words they're singing

- Mary defiance of Neal upon her return
	- Neal to Billy: "You wait, all right? Don't go walkabout"
		- "Walkabout" is a rite of passage for adolescent Aboriginal males, to
		  make the spiritual transition into manhood
		- Trivialising a significant part of their culture
	- Mary: "Go to hell! Fuck youse!"
	- Stage direction: "Billy holds her outstretched over a pile of flour bags.
	  Neal raises the cat-'o-nine tails. Blackout. A scream."
		- Very confronting for the audience, such a vile act of hateful racism
		  resulting from Mary's defile of his power
			- First direct view of physical oppression for the audience
		- Billy
			- Acquiesce in his own subjugation
			- Lost all identity and culture
			- Forced out of necessity to work for whites
				- Tragic
		- Even in the stage directions, short sentences to shock a reader of the
		  play's script

- Neal refusing to start a library
	- Neal: "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"
	- Refusing to educate natives so that he remains in power
	- Vestige of colonialism, keep away language from the subjugated to remain
	  in power, keep the proletariat uneducated, etc.
	- Neal: "Bloody do-gooders"
		- Cynical

- "Billy Kimberley ... dressed in new but absurdly ill-fitting uniforms"
	- Can be read as an allusion to Heart of Darkness
	- Fireman aboard the steamboat, "A dog in a parody of breeches and a feather
	  hat"
	- Emphasise how out of place Billy is, how far removed from his culture and
	  tradition, acquiescent in his subjugation, much like natives in Africa
	  under the control of European imperialists

- Neal: "And there will be no Christmas this year! No Christmas!"
	- Arrogant in thinking that he has complete control over Aboriginal people,
	  so much so that he can dictate the events they celebrate
		- Such perverse arrogance is just racist in the amount of control it
		  assumes Neville holds over these people
	- Ironic, that he's trying to remove a festivity that is completely foreign
	  to these people as a form of punishment

- Stage direction: "Jimmy runs out of breath, heaves and clutches his chest ...
  clutching at the flagpole"
	- Last act before dying is one last defiance of authority
	- "Flagpole" has the Union Jack on it, ironic, dying under the symbol of
	  colonialism, a force he's tried to hard to defy and overcome



Hybridised Culture
- Use of Aboriginal language, "dawarra", "mirri", "koorawoorung"
	- Highlights how they still attempt to retain vestiges of their culture in
	  modern Australia
	- Authenticates their experiences
	- Alienate audience from their culture
		- Empathise with Aboriginal people, in how they are excluded and
		  alienated from white Australian society
	- Sense of validation and inclusion felt by Nyoongah viewer of the play
		- An absent feeling from much of their interaction with white society
- David: "Woolah! Don Bradman" (p. 9, A1S1)
	- Oxymoron
	- Nyoongah shout of praise in reference to white sporting hero
	- Aboriginals have adapted to and adopted components of white Australian
	  culture, especially in their icons
- Joe: "He mimes throwing the doak at at a rabbit"
	- Stage direction
	- Hunting "rabits", an imported, non-native species, with traditional
	  Aboriginal hunting tools
- Gran: "Don't worry, we can use tjeerung bush"
	- Substituting soap with native alternative
	- Ability to adapt to adversity through holding on to their traditional
	  culture
- Joe: "I'm gunna show you my country. Got a big river, swans, beautiful white
  swans"
	- Ironic, as "white swans" are an imported species, only black swans are
	  native
	- Appreciating the beauty of a symbol of the culture oppressing him
- Gran: "Now cover you  in ashes. More better than Johnson's Baby Powder, eh?"
	- Traditional methods of bringing a baby into the world



Effects of Forced Assimilation
- Jimmy: "Yeah, fukin' gubmet" (government)
- Jimmy: Refuses to give mouth organ to Constable.
- Constable: "Just bloody-well hand it over", irate
- Jimmy: "Gaol's yuart, only a wetjala thing. Don't worry about it"
	- Jimmy rebels against authority
		- Jimmy: "I don't give two hoots of a lamb's tail"
	- No respect for Australia's imported justice system forced upon Aboriginal
	  people
- Jimmy: "Oh, bugger old baldy"
	- Alliteration of plosive "b" sound
- Stage direction: "Jimmy takes out a mouth organ and plays 'Home, Sweet Home'"
	- While Jimmy and Sam are in jail
	- Jimmy being sarcastic
	- How Aboriginal people fail to adhere to the imposed white justice system,
	  many consistently find themselves in jail, so much so that it becomes
	  their "home"
- Stage direction: "Jimmy crawls for his coat, then for the bottle"
	- Davis appears to acknowledge the problem with alcohol in the Aboriginal
	  community
	- "coat" then "bottle", how, for some, alcohol is as commonplace in their
	  life as clothing
	- Jimmy (stage direction): "He swings an ineffectual punch at Sam"
		- And the violent effects this has on their behaviour

- Davis includes this drinking problem, refusal to obey authority
- So as to not "demean" his Aboriginal characters by "always making them the
  goodies" (from The Dreamers)



Title
- "No Sugar", recalls Neville's statement "Sugar catches more flies than
  vinegar"
- Therefore the title is a bold renunciation of authority, refusing to obey
  Neville's suggestion



Strength of Aboriginal people, ability to survive
- Constant interruption and dominating presence of Aboriginal voice in many
  scenes
	- Gran with Sergeant
	- Jimmy at Neville's office, in court with the JP
	- Order and control is subverted, as Aboriginal voices refuse containment
- Emphasises their strength and willpower



Jimmy
- Rebel against authority
- Drinking problem



Frank Brown
- Shows the audience how even white men looking for work are struggling to
  provide for their families
	- He cannot "even raise a train fare to Perth to see them"
	- Sam: "How long since you seen your kids?", Frank: "Six months; haven't
	  even sent 'em any money"
- Shows the audience how much harder it must be for Aboriginals to find work,
  having to deal with racism in addition
- Disputes the idea that they are just lazy



Mary and Joe
- Mary and Joseph, Biblical reference
- Forced to flee Bethlehem before the planned massacre of children by King Herod
- Similarly, Mary and Joe flee Government Well in the face of horrible
  persecution under Mr. Neal (raping Mary)
- Sister Eileen mentions this story at Sunday school to the children
	- Sister: "He ordered his soldiers to kill every first-born baby boy under
	  two years old"
	- Ironic, just like the black trackers do to the babies of Aboriginal girls
	  who are raped by their white masters



Setting
- Can be set across multiple stages in different locations
- Forces the audience to move between stages
- Mimics the nomadic tendencies of the Aboriginal people
	- Symbolic of the forced distabilisation and displacement of Aboriginal
	  people
	- Requires the audience to become active participants in the drama, rather
	  than passive recipients

- 2 sides of the stage represent 2 different locations
- Northam (left side of stage)
	- Police station with 2 cells
	- Main street
	- Government Well Aboriginal Reserve
- Perth (left side of stage)
	- Office of the Chief Protector of Aborigines
		- Front and rear entrance, for whites and blacks repsectively
- Moore River Native Settlement (right side of stage)
	- Superintendent's office
	- Milliurra tent and camp
	- Clearing in the pine plantation
	- Lectern and flagpole
- Railway line
- Meetingroom for the WA Historical Society

- Use of open stage
	- How white society and the Aboriginal people are constantly interlinked
	  and must share the same space, despite whatever conflict exists between
	  them
	- Celebrates the refusal of Aboriginal characters to remain in their
	  prescribed boundaries
		- Ability to overcome
