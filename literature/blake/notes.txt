The Garden of Love
------------------

The disconnection of the Church as an institution from core Christian values
and traditions.


A Chapel was built in the midst
Where I used to play on the green

- "Chapel"
	- Synecdoche for the Church
	- Used in a pejorative sense
- "green"
	- "midst", binary opposition between the beauty of the natural landscape and
	the grotesque man-made building
	- Allusion to "The Echoing Green", Songs of Innocence
		- "The sun does arise, and make happy the skies"
		- Illustrates the harmony in nature
		- Prelapsarian idyllic image
- Images associated with the poems
	- "The Echoing Green", children playing around a tree, full of vibrant
	colour
	- "The Garden of Love", dull image of people kneeling in prayer
	- Juxtaposition
	- "Green" is a true creation of God
	- The Church is a creation of man that poorly mimics what it truely means to
	be a Christian


And the gates of this Chapel were shut,
And Thou shalt not. writ over the door

- "shut"
	- Chapel with shut gates is oxymoronic
	- Typically have open doors to welcome those desperately in need
- "Thou shalt not."
	- Biblical allusion to the 10 commandments of the Old Testament
		- 8 commandments contain this edict of prohibition
	- Expresses Blake's contempt for the strict and dogmatic teachings of the
	Church
	- Full stop in the middle of the sentence, sense of strict finality
- "shut", "writ"
	- Monosyllabic plosive sounds
	- Disdainful tone


And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,
And binding with briars, my joys and desires.

- "binding with briars..."
	- How the Church's dogmatic teachings divorces a person from their innate
	spirituality and imagination
	- Important to Blake in consideration of his context as a painter,
	illustrator, writer, poet
- "Binding"
	- Infant Sorrow
		- "bound and weary"
	- The Clod and The Pebble
		- "to bind another"
	- London
		- "mind-forg'd manacles"
	- Omnipresent, detrimental conditioning
- "briars"
	- Biblical allusion to Christ's crown of thorns
	- Used to mock Christ and denounce his authority leading up to his
	crucifixion
	- Tragically ironic, condoning an action (binding the imagination) the
	Church should condemn

Quatrains, ABCB rhyme scheme
- Clear restrictions on form symbolic for similar confinements the Church's
teachings place on the imagination




The Holy Thursday
-----------------

(Innocence)
- "The children walking two and two"
	- Regimented, marching
- "Grey-headed beadles walk'd before with wands as white as snow"
	- "wands", beating sticks

- Symbolic of the dull, omnipresent idea of Christian discipline, requiring
those like the children to "do their duty" without question
- Church's stifiling of the imagination




The Chimney Sweeper
-------------------

The Church's economic and social oppression of the lower classes, including the
exploitation of children.

(Innocence)
- "locked up in coffins of black"
	- Metaphor for the sooty chimneys they were forced to sweep
	- "coffins", alludes to their painful deaths from cancer and other torturous
	health complications that resulted from their work

(Innocence)
- "curled like a lamb's back"
	- Biblical allusion to Christ as the lamb of God
	- Symbol of innocence and purity
	- Conveys the innocence of the children exploited

(Experience)

And are gone to praise God and his Priest and King,
Who make up a heaven of our misery.

- "Priest and King"
	- Amalgamation of the Church and State
- "heaven of our misery"
	- Oxymoronic
	- How the Church and State condone and facilitate the exploitation of the
	lower class, including children, to make a heaven for themselves out of the
	misery and suffering of those beneath them
