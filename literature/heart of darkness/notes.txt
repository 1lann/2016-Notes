Themes
------

- "One of the most powerful indictments of colonialism ever written"
(F. Singh, 1988)

The detrimental effects of European colonialism on African and its people.


- "It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind."
	- Destroys any nobility or altruism associated with imperialism
	- "robbery", "murder", acknowledges the rights of the subjugated and the
	injustices committed against them


- (Of the brick layer) "papier-mâché Mephistopheles"
	- Brick layer synecdoche for European imperialists
	- "Mephistopheles"
		- Allusion to Faust, Western folklore
		- Surrender their moral integrity to the devil, Mephistopheles, in
		exchange for power
		- Symbolic for how many imperialists have surrendered their own moral
		integrity for power in Africa
		- Indictment of imperialism, suggesting its morally bankrupt nature
	- "papier-mache"
		- Any suggestion of a philanthropic or altruistic goal associated with
		imperialism is fake and hollow


- Likens the company headquarters to a "whited sepulchre"
	- Matthew 23:27, "scribes and Pharisees" are deemed "hypocrites", "full of
	dead men's bones, and all of uncleanness"
	- Headquarters act as a synecdoche for colonialism
	- How colonialism is built on "dead men's bones"
- (Marlow's Aunt) "weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways"
- "rudimentary souls"
	- Her belief in the philanthropic nature of colonialism
	- Hypocracy in Europe claiming to benefit Africa by bringing structure,
	civilisation, and proper Christian religion, when in fact all they export
	is death, exploiting the nation for their own material gain


- Likens colonialism to the "merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb"
	- Juxtaposition of sarcastically ironic use of the adjective "merry" and
	the deathly consequences of imperialism
	- "as of an overheated catacomb", simile further associates with vivid
	deathly imagery
		- Tactile, feel the heat of the catacomb
		- Olfactory, smell the hot stench of death
	- Criticism of imperialism


- "the great cause of these high and just proceedings", "the noble cause", "jolly pioneers of progress"
	- Contempt through a bitterly ironic tone
	- "proceedings", "cause", "progress", euphemisms


(Grove of Death Scene)
- "shapes", "shadows", "phantoms", "bundles of acute angles"
	- Dehumanises the native Africans
- "one of the creatures rose to his hands and knees, and went on all fours towards the river to drink."
	- Bestial metaphor
	- Behaviour typical of some grotesque monster
- "stepped into the gloomy circle of some Inferno"
	- Allusion to Dante's Inferno (Dr Robert Berry)
		- Journey of Dante through the circles of Hell
	- Construct Africa as a place of utter despair and torment
- "Black shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees leaning against the trunks, clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced within the dim light, in all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair"
	- Hellish visual imagery, almost auditory in use of "pain" and "despair"
	- Recalls the mass of prostrated bodies Dante observes throughout the
	Inferno
		- "Some souls were stretched out flat upon their backs, others were crouched there all tightly hunched, some wandered, never stopping, round and round"
	- Both cast in a language of excessive hyperbole, typical of epic poetry
- Evokes sympathy for the treatment of native Africans


- "All of Europe went into the making of Kurtz"
- French steamboat captain, Swedish former captain Fresleven, Russian Harlequin
	- Suggests all of Europe is to blame for such atrocities





Resistant Reading
-----------------

Chinua Achebe, "An Image of Africa", 1988

- "Africa is merely used as a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril"
- "preposterous and perverse arrogance" in using Africa as the setting for the "break up of one petty European mind"


- "What thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity - like yours - the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough"
	- Labels the "kinship" betweeen Europeans and native Africans as "ugly"
	- Disgust for these apparently savage beings
	- Qualifies it as "remote", need to feel psychologically and morally
	superior to native Africans


- Bestows fundamental human emotions on Kurtz's European intended, while
seemingly witholding it from his native African mistress.
- "She was savage and superb, wild eyed and magnificent ... and like the wilderness itself, [stood] with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose"
	- (F. R. Leavis) "Adjectival insistence upon the inexpressible and incomprensible"
		- Engenders an "oppressive mysteriousness in the Congo"
	- By defining the mistress in terms of the wilderness, Conrad removes any
	individuality or humanity
	- Relegating her to an ornament of the jungle
	- Recalls a description of the wilderness, "an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention"
		- Similarity in language, "brooding", "inscrutable"
		- Further negates her humanity
- "She was in mourning ... She had a mature capacity for fidelity, for belief, for suffering"
	- Juxtaposed against the character of Kurtz's intended
	- Binary opposition to the native African


- "unspeakable rites", "I don’t want to know anything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz"
	- Aversion to aquiring any knowledge of the traditional canablistic
	tendencies of the native tribes
	- Aversion to appreciating any culture other than his own
	- In fact, "fecund of cosmic insight and social development"
		- Johan Huizinga
